Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV , and finished in the beginning of the 15th century . The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158 -- 1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342 . This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge ( Kamenný most ) or Prague Bridge ( Pražský most ) but has been `` Charles Bridge '' since 1870 . As the only means of crossing the river Vltava ( Moldau ) until 1841 , Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city 's Old Town and adjacent areas . This `` solid - land '' connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe . </P> <P> The bridge is 621 metres ( 2,037 ft ) long and nearly 10 metres ( 33 ft ) wide , following the example of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg , it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards . It is protected by three bridge towers , two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side . The Old Town Bridge Tower is often considered to be one of the most astonishing civil gothic - style buildings in the world . The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries , most of them baroque - style , originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas . </P> <P> Repairs are scheduled to start in late 2019 , they should take around 20 years . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Through the 19th century </Li> <Li> 1.2 20th century to present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Statues on the bridge </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

Czech legend has it that construction began on Charles Bridge at 5 : 31am on 9 July 1357 with the first stone being laid by Charles IV himself . This exact time was very important to the Holy Roman Emperor because he was a strong believer of numerology and felt that this specific time , which formed a palindrome ( 1357 9 , 7 5 : 31 ) , was a numerical bridge , and would imbue Charles Bridge with additional strength . The bridge was completed 45 years later in 1402 . A flood in 1432 damaged three pillars . In 1496 the third arch ( counting from the Old Town side ) broke down after one of the pillars lowered , being undermined by the water ( repairs were finished in 1503 ) . A year after the Battle of White Mountain , when the 27 leaders of the anti-Habsburg revolt were executed on 21 June 1621 , the Old Town bridge tower served as a deterrent display of the severed heads of the victims to stop Czechs from further resistance . During the end of the Thirty Years ' War in 1648 , the Swedes occupied the west bank of the Vltava , and as they tried to advance into the Old Town the heaviest fighting took place right on the bridge . During the fighting , they severely damaged one side of the Old Town bridge tower ( the side facing the river ) and the remnants of almost all gothic decorations had to be removed from it afterward . During the late 17th century and early 18th century the bridge gained its typical appearance when an alley of baroque statues was installed on the pillars . During a great flood in 1784 , five pillars were severely damaged and although the arches did not break down , the traffic on the bridge had to be greatly restricted for some time . </P> <P> The original stairway to Kampa Island was replaced by a new one in 1844 . The next year , another great flood threatened the bridge , but the bridge escaped major damage . In 1848 , during the revolutionary days , the bridge escaped unharmed from the cannonade , but some of the statues were damaged . In 1866 , pseudo-gothic gas lights were erected on the balustrade ; they were later replaced with electric lighting . In the 1870s , the first regular public - transport ( omnibus ) line went over the bridge ( officially called `` Charles Bridge '' after 1870 ) later replaced by a horse tram . The bridge towers underwent a thorough reconstruction between 1874 and 1883 . </P> <P> On 2 -- 5 September 1890 , another disastrous flood struck Prague and severely damaged Charles Bridge . Thousands of rafts , logs and other floating materials that escaped from places upstream gradually formed a huge barrier leaning against the bridge . Three arches were torn down by the great pressure and two pillars collapsed from being undermined by the water , while others were partly damaged . With the fifth pillar , two statues -- St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Xavier , both by Ferdinand Brokoff -- also fell into the river . The former statue was replaced by a statuary of Saints Cyril and Methodius by Karel Dvořák ; the latter was replaced by a replica of the original . Repair works lasted for two years ( the bridge was reopened on 19 November 1892 ) and cost 665,000 crowns . </P> <H3> 20th century to present ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the beginning of the 20th century , Charles Bridge saw a steep rise of heavy traffic . The last day of the horse line on the bridge was 15 May 1905 , when it was replaced with an electric tram and later , in 1908 , with buses . At the end of World War II , a barricade was built in the Old Town bridge tower gateway . A capital repair of the bridge took place between 1965 and 1978 , based on a collaboration among various scientific and cultural institutes . The stability of the pillars was reassured , all broken stone blocks were replaced , and the asphalt top was removed . All vehicular traffic has been excluded from Charles Bridge since then , making it accessible by pedestrians only . The repair cost 50 million crowns . </P> <P> During the 1990s , some people started criticizing the previous reconstruction of the bridge and proposing further work . As of the beginning of the new millennium , most of the experts appeared to agree that the previous reconstruction had not been flawless but disputed the need for further interference with the bridge . However , after the disastrous floods of 2002 ( which themselves caused only minor harm to the bridge ) , support for an overall bridge reconstruction grew . It was decided that repair and stabilization of the two pillars ( numbers 8 and 9 ) on the Malá Strana side of the bridge would be done . These are the only river pillars that were not repaired after the 1890 floods . The reconstruction was a gradual process that closed off parts of the bridge without closing the span entirely . </P> <P> Performed from 2008 to 2010 , the work included bolstering the pillars and building a new hydroisolation system protecting the bridge . It also encompassed a re-pavimentation of the bridge 's pavement and the replacement of many of the stones in the bridge walls , a matter which was controversial due to a heavy - handed approach adopted by the restoration team , which had no previous experience in restoration of cultural heritage monuments . The result has been criticised by conservation professionals all over Europe ( see photos on external links ) , as dozens of new replacement stones do not match the historical ones they are next to , the amount of replaced stones is considered excessive , some stones have been inappropriately positioned , original stones have been chipped and joining materials employed are considered not appropriate for the structure . In 2010 UNESCO 's World Heritage Committee adopted a decision stating that `` the restoration of Charles Bridge was carried out without adequate conservation advice on materials and techniques '' . </P> Charles Bridge ( Karlův most ) , Vltava River , Prague , 2015 <H2> Statues on the bridge ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of statues on Charles Bridge Charles Bridge and the Holy Crucifix , c. 1935 <P> The avenue of 30 mostly baroque statues and statuaries situated on the balustrade forms a unique connection of artistic styles with the underlying gothic bridge . Most sculptures were erected between 1683 and 1714 . They depict various saints and patron saints venerated at that time . The most prominent Bohemian sculptors of the time took part in decorating the bridge , such as Matthias Braun , Jan Brokoff , and his sons Michael Joseph and Ferdinand Maxmilian . </P> <P> Among the most notable sculptures , one can find the statuaries of St. Luthgard , the Holy Crucifix and Calvary , and John of Nepomuk . Well known also is the statue of the knight Bruncvík , although it was erected some 200 years later and does not belong to the main avenue . </P> <P> Beginning in 1965 , all of the statues have been systematically replaced by replicas , and the originals have been exhibited in the Lapidarium of the National Museum . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Charles ' Bridge ( Karluv most ) '' .

Tarapur is the largest nuclear power station in India . It was constructed initially with two boiling water reactor ( BWR ) units by Bechtel and GE under the 1963 123 Agreement between India , the United States , and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . Units 1 and 2 were brought online for commercial operation on 28 October 1969 with an initial power of 210 MW of electricity , later on this was reduced to 160 MW due to technical difficulties . These were the first of their kind in Asia . More recently , an additional two pressurised heavy water reactor ( PHWR ) units of 540 MW each were constructed by L&T and Gammon India , seven months ahead of schedule and well within the original cost estimates . Unit 3 was brought online for commercial operation on 18 August 2006 , and unit 4 on 12 September 2005 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Safety concerns </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> With a total capacity of 1400 MW , Tarapur is the largest nuclear power station in India . The facility is operated by the NPCIL ( Nuclear Power Corporation of India ) . </P> <P> The personnel operating the power plant live in a residential complex called T.A.P.S. colony , 19 ° 48 ′ 58 '' N 72 ° 44 ′ 35 '' E ﻿ / ﻿ 19.816 ° N 72.743 ° E ﻿ / 19.816 ; 72.743 which is a fifteen - minute drive from Boisar , the nearest railway station . The residential complex was also constructed by Bechtel to house both Indian and American employees . Due to this , the residential complex had a very Indian small - town look , with neat sidewalks , spacious houses , a club with tennis courts , swimming pool , a commissary etc . While the original American residents have long gone , the colony continues to thrive . </P> <P> In 1974 after India conducted Smiling Buddha , its first nuclear weapons test the USA chose to no longer honor its agreement to supply the plant with enriched uranium . Nuclear fuel for TAPS has subsequently been delivered from France , China and Russia under IAEA safeguards . </P> <P> The residential colony now features 3 central schools run under Atomic Energy Education Society ( AEES ) . The local beach at Chinchani is approximately 7 kilometres ( 4.3 mi ) from the colony . </P> <H2> Safety concerns ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Boiling water reactors ( BWRs ) at Tarapur 1 and 2 units are similar to the reactors involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster . The reactors ' age and old design have raised safety concerns and according to one local leader , the two reactors had in 2011 already been in operation for 16 years more than their design lives . </P> <P> In 2007 , Atomic Energy Regulatory Board ( AERB ) evaluated seismic safety features at Tarapur 1 and 2 and reported many shortfalls , following which NPCIL installed seismic sensors . In 2011 , AERB formed a 10 - member committee , consisting of experts from Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT ) and India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) , to assess the vulnerability of the Tarapur to earthquakes and tsunamis . A. Gopalakrishnan , former director of AERB , said that Tarapur 1 and 2 reactors are much older than the reactors involved in the Fukushima nuclear accident and argued that they should be immediately decommissioned . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Maharashtra portal </Li> <Li> Energy portal </Li> <Li> Nuclear technology portal </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Tarapur Atomic Power Station . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Nuclear power in India </Li> <Li> Template : India nuke plant map </Li> <Li> List of Indian Nuclear Reactors </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Plants Under Operation - Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited '' .

Charles and his single friends wonder whether they will ever get married . Charles meets Carrie and spends the night with her . Carrie pretends that , now they have slept together , they will have to get married , to which Charles endeavours to respond before realising she is joking . Carrie observes that they may have missed an opportunity and then returns to America . </P> <P> The second wedding is that of Bernard and Lydia , a couple who became romantically involved at the previous wedding . Charles encounters Carrie again , but she introduces him to her fiancé , Sir Hamish Banks , a wealthy politician . At the reception , Charles finds himself seated with several ex-girlfriends who relate embarrassing stories about his inability to be discreet and afterwards bumps into Henrietta , known among Charles ' friends as `` Duckface '' , with whom he had a particularly difficult relationship . Charles retreats to an empty hotel suite , seeing Carrie and Hamish leave in a taxicab , only to be trapped in a cupboard after the newlyweds stumble into the room to have sex . After Charles awkwardly exits the room , Henrietta confronts him about his habit of `` serial monogamy '' , telling him he is afraid of letting anyone get too close to him . Charles then runs into Carrie , and they end up spending another night together . </P> <P> A month later , Charles receives an invitation to Carrie 's wedding . While shopping for a present , he coincidentally encounters Carrie and ends up helping her select her wedding dress . Carrie lists her more than thirty sexual partners . Charles later awkwardly tries confessing his love to her and hinting that he would like to have a relationship with her , to no avail . </P> <P> The third wedding is that of Carrie and Hamish . Charles attends , depressed at the prospect of Carrie marrying Hamish . At the reception , Gareth instructs his friends to seek potential mates ; Fiona 's brother , Tom , stumbles through an attempt to connect with a woman until she reveals that she is the minister 's wife , while Charles 's flatmate , Scarlett , strikes up a conversation with an American named Chester . As Charles watches Carrie and Hamish dance , Fiona deduces his feelings about Carrie . When Charles asks why Fiona is not married , she confesses that she has loved Charles since they first met years earlier . Charles is appreciative and empathetic but does not requite her love . During the groom 's toast , Gareth dies of a heart attack . </P> <P> At Gareth 's funeral , his partner Matthew recites the poem `` Funeral Blues '' by W.H. Auden , commemorating his relationship with Gareth . Charles and Tom discuss whether hoping to find your `` one true love '' is just a futile effort and ponder that , while their clique have always viewed themselves as proud to be single , Gareth and Matthew were a `` married '' couple all the while . </P> <P> The fourth wedding is ten months later . Charles has decided to marry Henrietta . However , shortly before the ceremony , Carrie arrives , revealing to Charles that she and Hamish are separated . Charles has a crisis of confidence , which he reveals to his deaf brother David and Matthew . During the ceremony , when the vicar asks whether anyone knows a reason why the couple should not marry , David , who was reading the vicar 's lips , asks Charles to translate for him , and says in sign language that he suspects the groom loves someone else . The vicar asks whether Charles does love someone else , and Charles replies , `` I do . '' Henrietta punches Charles and the wedding is halted . </P> <P> Carrie visits Charles to apologise for attending the wedding . Charles confesses that , while standing at the altar , he realised that for the first time in his life he totally and utterly loved one person , `` and it was n't the person standing next to me in the veil . '' Charles makes a proposal of lifelong commitment without marriage to Carrie , who accepts . </P> <P> Henrietta marries an officer in the Grenadier Guards ; David marries his girlfriend Serena ; Scarlett marries Chester ; Tom marries his distant cousin Deirdre ( whom he met , for the second time in 25 years , at Charles 's wedding ) ; Matthew finds a new partner ; Fiona marries Prince Charles ; and Charles and Carrie have a young son . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Hugh Grant as Charles </Li> <Li> Andie MacDowell as Carrie </Li> <Li> James Fleet as Tom </Li> <Li> Simon Callow as Gareth </Li> <Li> John Hannah as Matthew </Li> <Li> Kristin Scott Thomas as Fiona </Li> <Li> David Bower as David </Li> <Li> Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett </Li> <Li> Timothy Walker as Angus </Li> <Li> Sara Crowe as Laura </Li> <Li> Rowan Atkinson as Father Gerald </Li> <Li> David Haig as Bernard </Li> <Li> Sophie Thompson as Lydia </Li> <Li> Corin Redgrave as Sir Hamish Banks </Li> <Li> Anna Chancellor as Henrietta </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film was shot mainly in London and the Home Counties , including Hampstead , Islington where the final moments take place on Highbury Terrace , Greenwich Hospital , Betchworth in Surrey , Amersham in Buckinghamshire , St Bartholomew - the - Great ( wedding number four ) and West Thurrock in Essex . Exterior shots of guests arriving for the funeral were filmed in Thurrock , Essex overlooking the River Thames with the backdrop of the Dartford River Crossing and at stately homes in Bedfordshire ( Luton Hoo for wedding two 's reception ) and Hampshire . </P> <H2> Music ( edit ) </H2> <P> The original score was composed by British composer Richard Rodney Bennett . The movie also featured a soundtrack of popular songs , including a cover version of The Troggs ' `` Love Is All Around '' performed by Wet Wet Wet that remained at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart for fifteen weeks and was then the ninth ( now twelfth ) biggest selling single of all time in Britain . This song would later be adapted into `` Christmas Is All Around '' and sung by the character of Billy Mack in Richard Curtis ' 2003 film Love Actually , in which Grant also stars . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The film was very well received with critics , currently holding a 95 % `` Certified Fresh '' approval on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , with the site 's consensus stating , `` While frothy to a fault , Four Weddings and a Funeral features irresistibly breezy humor , and winsome performances from Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell . '' Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three - and - a-half stars out of four , calling it `` delightful and sly '' , and directed with `` light - hearted enchantment '' by Newell . He praised Grant 's performance , describing it as a kind of `` endearing awkwardness '' . </P> <P> The film had its detractors . Writing for the Chicago Reader , Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film `` generic '' and `` standard issue '' , stating that the audience should n't `` expect to remember it ten minutes later '' . Time magazine writer Richard Corliss was less scathing , but agreed that it was forgettable , saying that people would `` forget all about ( the movie ) by the time they leave the multiplex , '' even joking at the end of his review that he had forgotten the film 's name . The character of Carrie was voted one of the most annoying film characters of all time in a British online poll . </P> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> The film earned £ 27.8 million in the United Kingdom . Upon its North American limited release on 11 March 1994 , Four Weddings and a Funeral opened with $138,486 in five theatres . But upon its wide release on 15 April 1994 , the film topped the box office with $4,162,489 . The film would continue to gross $52.7 million in North America with an additional $193 million internationally , earning $245.7 million worldwide . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Wins ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dt> BAFTA Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Film </Li> <Li> Best Direction ( Mike Newell ) </Li> <Li> Best Actor ( Hugh Grant ) </Li> <Li> Best Supporting Actress ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Australian Film Institute </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Foreign Film </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> British Comedy Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Comedy Film </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> César Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> César Award for Best Foreign Film </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Chicago Film Critics </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Most Promising Actor ( Hugh Grant ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Evening Standard Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Actress ( Kristin Scott Thomas ) </Li> <Li> Best Screenplay ( Richard Curtis ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Golden Globe Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy ( Hugh Grant ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> London Film Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> British Film of the Year </Li> <Li> British Director of the Year ( Mike Newell ) </Li> <Li> British Producer of the Year ( Duncan Kenworthy ) </Li> <Li> British Screenwriter of the Year ( Richard Curtis ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Writers Guild of America Award </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Original Screenplay ( Richard Curtis ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Writers ' Guild of Great Britain </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Film -- Screenplay ( Richard Curtis ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> Nominations ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dt> Academy Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Picture ( lost to Forrest Gump ) </Li> <Li> Best Original Screenplay -- Richard Curtis ( lost to Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary for Pulp Fiction ) </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> BAFTA Awards </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Best Film Music -- Richard Rodney Bennett ( lost to Backbeat ) </Li> <Li> Best Original Screenplay -- Richard Curtis ( lost to Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary for Pulp Fiction ) </Li> <Li> Best Supporting Actor -- Simon Callow ( lost to Samuel L.

      "context": "Basic education - Wikipedia <H1> Basic education </H1> Jump to : navigation , search For the Buddhist ' Basic education for all ' , see Nai Talim . <P> According to the International Standard Classification of Education ( ISCED ) , basic education comprises the two stages primary education and lower secondary education . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Universal basic education </Li> <Li> 2 Gender equality in basic education </Li> <Li> 3 Basic Education by Mahatma Gandhi </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 Sources </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Universal basic education ( edit ) </H2> <P> Basic education featured heavily in the 1997 ISCED document , but the term was not included in the glossary . Each country interpreted the term in different ways , and leading up to the 2011 revision , a discussion paper was issued to seek clarification . </P> <P> In most countries , ISCED 1 corresponds to the nationally designated primary education , and basic education includes that and also ISCED 2 lower secondary education ( the lower level of secondary school ) . In other countries , where there is no break between primary and lower secondary education `` basic education '' covers the entire compulsory school period . For statistical reasons , ISCED 1 is then considered to be the first six years of schooling . </P> <P> Universal basic education is regarded as a priority for developing countries and is the focus of the Education For All movement led by UNESCO . It is also included in the Millennium Development Goals as goal number 2 : achieve universal primary education by 2015 . </P> <P> An extensive number of studies have proven its benefits for public health ( e.g. lower spread of HIV / AIDS ; better vaccination ; prevention and medication of disease ; better nutrition ; lower maternal , infant , and child mortality ) , demography ( e.g. longer life expectancy , accelerated demographic transition through better birth control ) and the economy ( e.g. increased purchase power , increased productivity in traditional sectors , increased demand on service sectors ) . Other benefits , although more difficult to measure , include a beneficial impact on democracy , human rights , governance , and political stability through increased understanding of non-violent ways to solve problems and mutual understanding between groups in conflict . </P> <P> The Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) , established by UNICEF in 1989 , protects children 's inalienable rights by setting standards for multiple issues , one of which is education . </P> <H2> Gender equality in basic education ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Sex differences in education <P> Gender equality in education has traditionally been narrowly equated with gender parity at different levels of formal education . Gender has been a traditional factor of inequality and disparity in education , most often to the disadvantage of girls and women . Yet there has been significant progress in narrowing the gap around the world since 2000 , with a larger proportion of girls and women accessing different levels of formal education . Indeed , gender parity in primary education has been achieved in Central and Eastern Europe , Central Asia , East Asia and the Pacific , Latin America and the Caribbean , North America and Western Europe . In addition , significant progress has been made since 2000 in narrowing the gender gap , particularly in South and West Asia and to a lesser degree in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States . However , despite the significant progress made , the majority of out - of - school children are girls , while two - thirds of youth and adults with low levels of literacy in the world are women . To help ensure women 's empowerment , boys and men must also be engaged in the fight against gender inequality . This must begin with basic education . </P> <H2> Basic education by Mahatma Gandhi ( edit ) </H2> <P> The pedagogic goals of Basic Education by Mahatma Gandhi are general and complex pedagogic targets and conrete pedagogic targets . The general targets are lifelong education , social education and integral education . The conrete pedagogic targets are craftwork , native language , co-education , the village community , hygiene - the Programme of safai - and reading and writing . </P> <P> </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> International Standard Classification of Education </Li> <Li> K -- 12 ( education ) </Li> <Li> Educational stage </Li> <Li> Primary education </Li> <Li> Secondary education </Li> </Ul> <H2> Sources ( edit ) </H2> <P> This article incorporates text from a free content work .

The film is about three United States servicemen readjusting to civilian life after coming home from World War II . Samuel Goldwyn was inspired to produce a film about veterans after reading an August 7 , 1944 , article in Time about the difficulties experienced by men returning to civilian life . Goldwyn hired former war correspondent MacKinlay Kantor to write a screenplay . His work was first published as a novella , Glory for Me , which Kantor wrote in blank verse . Robert E. Sherwood then adapted the novella as a screenplay . </P> <P> The Best Years of Our Lives won seven Academy Awards in 1946 , including Best Picture , Best Director ( William Wyler ) , Best Actor ( Fredric March ) , Best Supporting Actor ( Harold Russell ) , Best Film Editing ( Daniel Mandell ) , Best Adapted Screenplay ( Robert E. Sherwood ) , and Best Original Score ( Hugo Friedhofer ) . In addition to its critical success , the film quickly became a great commercial success upon release . It became the highest - grossing film and most attended film in both the United States and UK since the release of Gone with the Wind , selling approximately 55 million tickets in the United States which equaled a gross of $23,650,000 . It remains the sixth most - attended film of all time in the UK , with over 20 million tickets sold . The film had one of the highest viewing figures of all time , with ticket sales exceeding $20.4 million . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Critical response </Li> <Li> 4.2 Popular response </Li> <Li> 4.3 Awards and honors </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 5.2 Citations </Li> <Li> 5.3 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> After World War II , Fred Derry ( Dana Andrews ) , Homer Parrish ( Harold Russell ) , and Al Stephenson ( Fredric March ) meet while flying home to Boone City ( a fictional city patterned after Cincinnati , Ohio ) . Fred was a decorated Army Air Forces captain and bombardier in Europe . Homer lost both hands from burns suffered when his aircraft carrier was sunk , and now uses mechanical hook prostheses . Al served as an infantry platoon sergeant in the Pacific . All three have trouble adjusting to civilian life . </P> <P> Al has a comfortable home and a loving family : wife Milly ( Myrna Loy ) , adult daughter Peggy ( Teresa Wright , who was only thirteen years Loy 's junior ) , and college freshman son Rob ( Michael Hall , who is absent after the first one - third of the film ) . He returns to his old job as a bank loan officer . The bank president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen . When Al approves a loan ( without collateral ) to a young Navy veteran , however , the president advises him against making a habit of it . Later , at a banquet held in his honor , a slightly inebriated Al expounds his belief that the bank ( and America ) must stand with the vets who risked everything to defend the country and give them every chance to rebuild their lives . </P> <P> Before the war , Fred had been an unskilled drugstore soda jerk . He wants something better , but the tight postwar job market forces him to return to his old job . Fred had met Marie ( Virginia Mayo ) while in flight training and married her shortly afterward , before shipping out less than a month later . She became a nightclub waitress while Fred was overseas . Marie makes it clear she does not enjoy being married to a lowly soda jerk . </P> <P> Homer was a football quarterback and became engaged to his next door neighbor , Wilma ( Cathy O'Donnell ) , before joining the Navy . Both Homer and his parents now have trouble dealing with his disability . He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away , although she still wants to marry him . </P> <P> Peggy meets Fred while bringing her father home from a bar where the three men meet once again . They are attracted to each other . Peggy dislikes Marie , and informs her parents she intends to end Fred and Marie 's marriage , but they tell her that their own marriage overcame similar problems . Concerned , Al demands that Fred stop seeing his daughter . Fred agrees , but the friendship between the two men is strained . </P> <P> At the drugstore , an obnoxious customer , who claims that the war was fought against the wrong enemies , gets into a fight with Homer . Fred intervenes and knocks the man into a glass counter , costing him his job . Later , Fred encourages Homer to put his misgivings behind him and marry Wilma , offering to be his best man . </P> <P> One evening , Wilma visits Homer and tells him that her parents want her to leave Boone City for an extended period to try to forget him . Homer bluntly demonstrates to her how hard life with him would be . When Wilma is undaunted , Homer reconsiders . </P> <P> On arriving home , Fred discovers his wife with another veteran ( Steve Cochran ) . After complaining to Fred that she has `` given up the best years of my life , '' Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce . Fred decides to leave town , and gives his father his medals and citations . His father is unable to persuade Fred to stay . After Fred leaves , his father reads the citation for his Distinguished Flying Cross as composed by General Doolittle . At the airport , Fred books space on the first outbound aircraft , without regard for the destination . While waiting , he wanders into a vast aircraft boneyard . Inside the nose of a B - 17 , he relives the intense memories of combat . The boss of a work crew rouses him from his flashback . When the man says the aluminum from the aircraft is being salvaged to build housing , Fred persuades the boss to hire him . </P> <P> At the bride 's home , people have gathered for the wedding of Homer and Wilma . Fred , now divorced , is Homer 's best man . While the vows are exchanged Fred and Peggy glance across at one another . At the conclusion everyone gathers around the newlyweds . Still gazing over at Peggy , Fred walks across the room , takes her in his arms and kisses her . He asks if she understands how things will be for them , that it will be a hard struggle at first , and that it could take years before they can get a life established . All the while Peggy smiles fondly at Fred , and then kisses him again . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Myrna Loy as Milly Stephenson </Li> <Li> Fredric March as Platoon Sergeant Al Stephenson </Li> <Li> Dana Andrews as Captain Fred Derry </Li> <Li> Teresa Wright as Peggy Stephenson </Li> <Li> Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry </Li> <Li> Cathy O'Donnell as Wilma Cameron </Li> <Li> Hoagy Carmichael as Uncle Butch Engle </Li> <Li> Harold Russell as Petty Officer 2nd Class Homer Parrish </Li> <Li> Gladys George as Hortense Derry </Li> <Li> Roman Bohnen as Pat Derry </Li> <Li> Ray Collins as Mr. Milton </Li> <Li> Minna Gombell as Mrs. Parrish </Li> <Li> Walter Baldwin as Mr. Parrish </Li> <Li> Steve Cochran as Cliff </Li> <Li> Dorothy Adams as Mrs. Cameron </Li> <Li> Don Beddoe as Mr. Cameron </Li> <Li> Marlene Aames as Luella Parrish </Li> <Li> Charles Halton as Prew </Li> <Li> Ray Teal as Mr. Mollett </Li> <Li> Howland Chamberlain as Thorpe </Li> <Li> Dean White as Novak </Li> <Li> Erskine Sanford as Bullard </Li> <Li> Michael Hall as Rob Stephenson </Li> <Li> Victor Cutler as Woody Merrill </Li> <Li> Robert Karnes as Technical Sergeant </Li> </Ul> <P> Casting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns . Famed drummer Gene Krupa was seen in archival footage , while Tennessee Ernie Ford , later a famous television star , appeared as an uncredited `` hillbilly singer '' ( in the first of his only three film appearances ) . Blake Edwards , later notable as a film producer and director , appeared fleetingly as an uncredited `` Corporal '' . Actress Judy Wyler was cast in her first role in her father 's production . Sean Penn 's father , Leo , played the uncredited part of the soldier working as the scheduling clerk at the beginning of the film . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> Director Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming Memphis Belle ( 1944 ) and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered . Wyler changed the original casting that had featured a veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder and sought out Harold Russell , a non-actor to take on the exacting role of Homer Parrish . </P> <P> For The Best Years of Our Lives , he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes , in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling . Other Wyler touches included constructing life - size sets , which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions . The impact for the audience was immediate , as each scene played out in a realistic , natural way . </P> <P> The Best Years of Our Lives began filming on April 15 , 1946 at a variety of locations , including the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden , Ontario International Airport , Ontario , California , Raleigh Studios , Hollywood , and the Samuel Goldwyn / Warner Hollywood Studios . The Best Years of Our Lives is notable for cinematographer Gregg Toland 's use of deep focus photography , in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp focus . For the passage of Fred Derry 's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber , Wyler used `` zoom '' effects to simulate Derry 's subjective state . </P> <P> The `` Jackson High '' football stadium seen early in aerial footage of the bomber flying over the fictional Boone City , is Corcoran Stadium located at Xavier University in Cincinnati . A few seconds later Walnut Hills High School with its distinctive dome and football field can be seen along with the downtown Cincinnati skyline ( Carew Tower and PNC Tower ) in the background . </P> <P> After the war , the combat aircraft featured in the film were being destroyed and disassembled for reuse as scrap material . The scene of Derry 's walking among aircraft ruins was filmed at the Ontario Army Air Field in Ontario , California . The former training facility had been converted into a scrap yard , housing nearly 2,000 former combat aircraft in various states of disassembly and reclamation . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Upon its release , The Best Years of Our Lives received extremely positive reviews from critics . Shortly after its premiere at the Astor Theater , New York , Bosley Crowther , film critic for The New York Times , hailed the film as a masterpiece . He wrote , </P> <P> It is seldom that there comes a motion picture which can be wholly and enthusiastically endorsed not only as superlative entertainment but as food for quiet and humanizing thought ... In working out their solutions Mr. Sherwood and Mr. Wyler have achieved some of the most beautiful and inspiring demonstrations of human fortitude that we have had in films . '' He also said the ensemble casting gave the `` ' best ' performance in this best film this year from Hollywood . '' </P> <P> Several decades later , film critic David Thomson offered tempered praise : `` I would concede that Best Years is decent and humane ... acutely observed , despite being so meticulous a package . It would have taken uncommon genius and daring at that time to sneak a view of an untidy or unresolved America past Goldwyn or the public . '' </P> <P> The Best Years of Our Lives has a 98 % `` Fresh '' rating at Rotten Tomatoes , based on 37 reviews . Chicago Sun Times film critic Roger Ebert put the film on his `` Great Movies '' list in 2007 , calling it `` ... modern , lean , and honest . '' </P> <H3> Popular response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Best Years of Our Lives was a massive commercial success , earning an estimated $11.5 million at the North American box office during its initial theatrical run . When box office prices are adjusted for inflation , it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history . </P> <P> Among films released before 1950 , only Gone With the Wind , The Bells of St. Mary 's , The Big Parade and four Disney titles have done more total business , in part due to later re-releases . ( Reliable box office figures for certain early films such as Birth of a Nation and Charlie Chaplin 's comedies are unavailable . ) </P> <P> However , because of the distribution arrangement RKO had with Goldwyn , RKO recorded a loss of $660,000 on the film . </P> <H3> Awards and honors ( edit ) </H3> <P> 1947 Academy Awards The Best Years of Our Lives received nine Academy Awards . Fredric March won his second Best Actor award ( also having won in 1932 for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ) . </P> <P> Despite his Oscar - nominated performance , Harold Russell was not a professional actor . As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win , they gave him an honorary award `` for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance . '' When Russell in fact won Best Supporting Actor , there was an enthusiastic response . He is the only actor to have received two Academy Awards for the same performance . He later sold his Best Supporting Actor award at auction for $60,500 , to pay his wife 's medical bills . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Winner </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Motion Picture </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> Samuel Goldwyn Productions ( Samuel Goldwyn , Producer ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Director </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> William Wyler </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actor </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> Fredric March </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Writing ( Screenplay ) </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> Robert E.

      "context": "List of Family Guy cast members - wikipedia <H1> List of Family Guy cast members </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane also provides the voices of Peter Griffin , Stewie Griffin , Brian Griffin , and Glenn Quagmire . <P> Family Guy is an American animated sitcom that features five main voice actors , and numerous regular cast and recurring guest stars . The principal voice cast consists of show creator Seth MacFarlane , Alex Borstein , Mila Kunis ( who replaced Lacey Chabert after the first season ( her last episode is `` Holy Crap , '' now marketed as the second episode of season two ) ) , Seth Green , and Mike Henry . Recurring voice actors include Patrick Warburton , Adam West , John G. Brennan , Nicole Sullivan and Jennifer Tilly , and repeat guest stars include Phyllis Diller , Charles Durning , Rush Limbaugh , and Phil LaMarr . </P> <P> Many cast members provide voices for multiple characters . The voice actors , in portraying the various character personalities on the show , draw inspiration from celebrities and pop culture . Family Guy characters have been played by more than one actor , after members of the show left the series or had conflicting obligations . </P> <P> Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award for voicing Meg Griffin in the season 5 episode `` Barely Legal '' and MacFarlane has also won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice - Over Performance and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production , though no other cast member has won an award for their work on the series . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Current cast <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Seth MacFarlane </Li> <Li> 1.2 Alex Borstein </Li> <Li> 1.3 Mila Kunis </Li> <Li> 1.4 Seth Green </Li> <Li> 1.5 Mike Henry </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Recurring cast </Li> <Li> 3 Recurring guest voices </Li> <Li> 4 Casting changes </Li> <Li> 5 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Current cast ( edit ) </H2> Seth Green provides the voice of Chris Griffin . Mike Henry voices various characters in the series . Mila Kunis provides the voice of Meg Griffin . Alex Borstein provides the voice of Lois Griffin . Patrick Warburton provides the voice of Joe Swanson . The real Adam West provided the voice of Mayor Adam West . <P> From seasons 1 to 4 , Family Guy had four main cast members . Since season 5 , there have been five main cast members . The casting of Meg Griffin changed after season 1 . </P> <H3> Seth MacFarlane ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seth MacFarlane voices three of the show 's main characters : Peter Griffin , Brian Griffin , and Stewie Griffin . MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself , believing it would be easier to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it . MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design . Stewie 's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison , especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady . MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian . </P> <P> MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one - time only characters , most prominently those of news anchor Tom Tucker , Lois ' father Carter Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman . He is the only voice to be in every episode . </P> <H3> Alex Borstein ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin , Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa , Loretta Brown and Lois ' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt . Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv . She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was `` really sight unseen '' . At the time , Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles , in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins . The voice was originally slower ( and deeper for the original series ) , but when MacFarlane heard it , he replied `` Make it a little less fucking annoying ... and speed it up , or every episode will last four hours . '' </P> <H3> Mila Kunis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mila Kunis voices Meg Griffin . Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character , in part due to her performance on That ' 70s Show . MacFarlane called Kunis back after her first audition , instructing her to speak slower , and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more . Once she claimed that she had it under control , MacFarlane hired her . Kunis described her character as `` the scapegoat '' . She further explained , `` Meg gets picked on a lot . But it 's funny . It 's like the middle child . She is constantly in the state of being an awkward 14 - year - old , when you 're kind of going through puberty and what - not . She 's just in a perpetual mode of humiliation . And it 's fun . '' </P> <H3> Seth Green ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seth Green primarily plays Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman . Green stated that he did an impression of the `` Buffalo Bill '' character from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition . His main inspiration for Chris ' voice came from envisioning how `` Buffalo Bill '' would sound if he were speaking through a public address system at a McDonald 's . </P> <H3> Mike Henry ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mike Henry is the voice of Cleveland Brown , John Herbert The Pervert and various other characters . A Family Guy writer and producer , he began acting on the show as part of the recurring cast repertory ( see below ) but was promoted to main cast member in 2005 . Since the cancellation of The Cleveland Show , he also voices Cleveland 's step - son Rallo Tubbs on Family Guy . </P> <H2> Recurring cast ( edit ) </H2> <P> In addition to both its main cast and guest stars , Family Guy utilizes a deep bench of regularly appearing supporting voice actors . Some appear in nearly every episode each season , while others appear less frequently . Some of these actors specifically play recurring characters , while others mainly play background citizens of Quahog or characters in cutaway gags . </P> <P> The current supporting cast repertory includes the following actors : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Actor </Th> <Th> Character ( s ) </Th> <Th> No. of Episodes ( Out of 245 produced ) </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Benjamin , H.

      "context": "Many happy returns ( greeting ) - wikipedia <H1> Many happy returns ( greeting ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Many Happy Returns . <P> `` Many happy returns '' is a greeting which is used by some on birthdays , and by others in response to `` Merry Christmas '' and `` Happy New Year '' . Since the 18th century this has been used as a salutation to offer the hope that a happy day being marked would recur many more times . It is now primarily used , by some , on birthdays . Prior to the mid-19th century , it was used at any celebratory or festive event . The phrase is more common in British English , Indian English , Hiberno English and to some degree in Canadian English than in American English . </P> <P> Current usage is often as a more formal option than `` Happy Birthday '' . It is also often found on greetings cards . </P> <P> Its earliest attributable use was by Lady Newdigate in a letter written in 1789 ( and published in Newdigate - Newdegate Cheverels in 1898 ) </P> <P> Many happy returns of þ day to us my D Love </P> <P> The letter was written in London on 31 May 1789 by Hester Margaretta , Lady Newdigate , to her husband , Sir Roger Newdigate , 5th Baronet , and refers to a wish for their wedding day . </P> <P> A much earlier reference is found in Joseph Addison 's newspaper The Freeholder : </P> <P> The usual Salutation to a Man upon his Birth - day among the ancient Romans was Multos & foelices ; in which they wished him many happy Returns of it . </P> <P> An alternative explanation is that `` returns '' here is used in the sense of `` yield '' or `` profit '' that it is still found in `` investment returns '' . Therefore , `` many happy returns of the day '' would be a wishing a person a rewarding day , full of happiness . This use has been traced back to Joseph Addison in 1716 . </P> <P> `` Many happy returns '' is Winnie - the - Pooh 's preferred method of wishing people a happy birthday , as seen throughout the story `` In Which Eeyore has a Birthday and Gets Two Presents '' in the 1926 collection Winnie - the - Pooh . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The Cheverels of Cheverel manor - by Lady Newdigate - Newdegate author of ' Gossip from a Muniment Room ' - With Illustrations from Family Portraits '' , Longmans Green & Co , 1898 ; Chapter VI , page 84 . see also `` Cavalier and Puritan in the days of the Stuarts : compiled from the private papers and diary of Sir Richard Newdigate , second Baronet , with extracts from ms . news - letters addressed to him between 1675 and 1689 '' , by Lady Anne Emily Garnier Newdigate - Newdegate .

'' </P> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> <P> Juniper Beatrice `` Junie B .

She has many catchphrases such as ; `` Wowie wow wow ! '' , `` Yeah , only '' , and `` Hello ! How are you today ? '' . She is afraid of roosters because she thinks `` they can peck your head into a nub '' , ponies because she thinks `` they can stomple you to the ground and kill you '' , and clowns because she thinks `` they are not normal people '' . She is shown to have reddish - brown hair and blue - green eyes . In the kindergarten series she was shown with short hair and a bow , she wears a pink sweater , purple skirt , white socks and signature black Mary Jane shoes . In the first grade series she had longer , messier hair , wore pants , and the bow was dropped , being replaced by her purple glasses . In Junie B. Jones is A Beauty Shop Guy , she is shown that she wants to be a beauty shop guy herself , though in Junie B. Jones and her Big Fat Mouth she wants to be a janitor when she grows up . In Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business , her grandpa lets her put syrup on her waffles without saying `` WHOA ! WHOA ! WHOA ! '' It 's also implied that she and her family possibly lives in Arizona . </P> <P> Robert `` Bob '' Jones : Junie B. and Ollie 's loving father , whom Junie B. calls `` Daddy . '' He takes Junie B. to the beauty shop with him in Junie B. Jones is a Beauty Shop Guy , where she causes a disaster . In Junie B. , First Grader : One Man Band , he teaches Junie B. to juggle .

Jones has a Monster Under her Bed and BOO ! And I MEAN It ! . In `` Aloha - ha - ha ! '' , Junie B. 's mother brings her a new Hawaiian Barbie doll which Junie B. names Delores . Philip Johnny Bob is shown to dislike Delores because of her `` pointy , hard hands '' poking him in the backpack while on the trip to Hawaii . Delores is only mentioned in this book . </P> <P> Susan Jones ( née Miller ) : Junie B. 's and Ollie 's protective but caring mother , whom Junie B. calls `` Mother . '' Since Junie B. loves ice cream , Susan made a rule at the grocery store that Junie B. ca n't shout `` I WANT ICE CREAM ! '' and not to call her a `` big meanie '' when she wo n't buy it . In `` Junie B. Jones and Some Sneaky Peeky Spying '' , she gets very annoyed with Junie B. spying but despite her attempts , Junie B. continues to spy on people .

He is said to be ten months old in the month of October , so he is probably born in December . Junie B. often dislikes her brother , and they have somewhat of a sibling rivalry , stating that the family did n't actually need a baby but no one consulted her about it . However , she does show that she cares for him sometimes , like in Junie B. , First Grader : Toothless Wonder where Junie B. concludes that Ollie 's first tooth was the baby tooth Junie B. lost , and she smiles at him . Ollie 's first word was `` moo '' which was revealed in Junie B. , First Grader : BOO ... and I MEAN It ! which was the reason he was dressed up in a cow suit . In Junie B. Jones and That Meanie Jim 's Birthday he is shown to have a hard time getting to sleep . </P> <P> Frank Miller ( Grampa Miller ) : Junie B. 's grandfather . Grampa Miller , along with his wife , Helen Miller , babysits for her and her brother while their parents are at work .

Jones Series and there is also a Junie B. Jones Journal . The Junie B. Jones series has also been translated into Spanish and French . </P> <P> Junie B Jones The Junie B. Jones series came in at # 71 on the American Library Association 's list of the Top 100 Banned or Challenged Books from 2000 - 2009 . Reasons cited are poor social values taught by the books and Junie B. Jones not being considered a good role model due to her mouthiness and bad spelling and grammar . While Junie B. Jones writer Barbara Park appreciated being on banned lists with writers she respected ( like Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison ) , she stopped reading information about her books because the comments were `` too hurtful '' . Park once wrote that some people `` believe that the value of a children 's book can be measured only in terms of the moral lessons it tries to impose or the perfect role models it offers . Personally , I happen to think that a book is of extraordinary value if it gives the reader nothing more than a smile or two . In fact , I happen to think that 's huge .

In 1936 , Alan Dinehart legally changed his name to Mason Alan Dinehart , the same name as his father , so that his younger son from the second marriage could be known as Mason Alan Dinehart III . This name change created confusion because the senior Dinehart 's first son from his first marriage was already Alan Dinehart , Jr. ( 1918 -- 1992 ) , the former animation and voice director for Hanna - Barbera . </P> <P> Mason Alan Dinehart is the father of eight children from three marriages . He has two children each from his first and second marriages to Evelyn Myers ( 1954 -- 1958 ) and Barbara Blakely ( 1958 -- 1965 ) , respectively . In 1982 , he married for the third time ; he and the former Miranda Gazal have four children . One of his children , Scott Dinehart , died in 2010 of an emergency hip operation . </P> <H2> Bat Masterson ( edit ) </H2> <P> Dinehart played the youthful Bat Masterson who is the understudy of Wyatt Earp in learning the proper techniques of frontier law enforcement . Earp rarely calls him `` Bat '' but `` Mr. Masterson '' to teach the young man maturity . In a 1956 episode `` Bat Masterson Again , '' Earp shows young Masterson on the proper use of a pistol . During this time Masterson was elected sheriff of Ford County , Kansas , which includes the county seat of Dodge City . Bill Tilghman had been denied the right to run for sheriff again . Earp as an appointed town marshal works with an elected sheriff , and their differences in jurisdiction do not cause any problems . Bat 's brother , Ed Masterson , played by Brad Johnson , formerly the deputy sheriff on the Annie Oakley television series , is shot in an ambush by drunken cowboys , and Masterson settles the score . When Earp finally comes to Tombstone , Arizona Territory , he lacks the working relationship with Sheriff Johnny Behan that he had in Kansas with Bat Masterson . </P> <P> Dinehart 's performance of Masterson was so highly regarded that ABC offered him a spinoff series , but he declined , soon left acting , and entered the business field . Dinehart 's last appearance on the series is the episode `` Dodge Is Civilized '' ( April 28 , 1959 ) , in which he serves notice that he is headed to Tombstone , where he hopes Earp will join him in time . There is never a reunion show , and the Masterson character , now a gambler , is written out of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp . The historical Earp did visit Tombstone to see his friend Masterson , who in time became a figure of western folklore , finishing his long career as a sportswriter in New York City . Masterson 's hat inspired the name of the Brown Derby restaurants in Los Angeles . </P> <P> By the time Dinehart left The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp , Gene Barry had already assumed for nearly a year the role of a more mature Masterson , one in his early forties , in the NBC western series Bat Masterson . Some viewers complained of the change in actors portraying Bat Masterson , but in time Barry was the one most remembered for the role , not Dinehart , who left show business . </P> <H2> Other acting roles ( edit ) </H2> <P> Dinehart 's first acting role was uncredited as `` Superman '' at the age of twelve in the 1948 film Superman . Dinehart was the first actor on screen to play Superman. * He played Superman as a boy diving into a haystack to recover his mother 's lost ring , using his Xray vision to find it . Thereafter , he had uncredited roles as a teenager in other films . In 1954 , he was cast as Ted Miller in the episode `` Hot Rod '' of the CBS legal drama series The Public Defender . In 1956 , he played Clint Donoran in the episode `` Outlaw 's Son '' of the syndicated television series Judge Roy Bean , starring Edgar Buchanan in the title role . In 1957 , he was cast as Danny Martin in the episode `` Typhoid '' of another syndicated series Dr. Christian , starring MacDonald Carey . </P> <P> Dinehart appeared in two 1957 military drama series , as Marly in the episode `` Joe Foss , Devilbird '' of Navy Log . This episode is based on a real person , Joe Foss , a World War II Medal of Honor recipient who later became the governor of South Dakota and a prominent sportsman . In 1957 and 1958 , Dinehart played Joe Marrison in two episodes , `` Seawall '' and `` The Boxing Lesson , '' of the syndicated series , Men of Annapolis . </P> <P> In 1957 and 1958 , he played in two youth films , as Bob Williams in The Careless Years and Joe Wilson in The Hot Angel . Other Dinehart appearances were on Sky King as Jimmy Ness in `` Frogmen '' and as Tex Fallon in `` The Unwanted '' on 26 Men . He played the character Greg in `` Half a Loaf '' on the syndicated western anthology series Death Valley Days , hosted in 1959 by Stanley Andrews . This role united Dinehart with western actor Bob Steele in the role of Dawson ; Steele had appeared as Deputy Sam in four episodes of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp . </P> <P> Dinehart was cast in two episodes , `` The Homesteaders '' and `` The Twisted Road , '' of the syndicated western series Frontier Doctor , starring Rex Allen . He played Don Carter in the 1959 episode `` Millionaire Sally Simms '' opposite Venetia Stevenson on the CBS fantasy drama The Millionaire . In 1959 , he was cast as Danny Holden in the episode `` Love on the Rocks '' , with Virginia Christine as Rena Desmond , on the syndicated crime drama State Trooper , with Rod Cameron as the fictitious officer Rod Blake of the Nevada State Police . Dinehart also played a comedy role as `` Bill Masterson '' in the 1957 episode `` The General '' of the CBS series The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show , with George Burns and Gracie Allen . </P> <P> Dinehart 's last roles were in 1959 and 1960 , including three appearances on the CBS series The Texan , starring Rory Calhoun . Twice he played `` The Brazos Kid '' . Dinehart played Todd Kenyon in the episode `` The Swindle '' of the 11 - episode NBC crime drama 21 Beacon Street , a summer - replacement series starring Dennis Morgan , Joanna Barnes , and Brian Kelly . Dinehart 's last screen appearance was as Bob Treadwell in the 1960 film Platinum High School . </P> <P> Dinehart 's business career began c. 1960 with the Bank of America . He is now a consultant in litigation and arbitration for FEND , a company based in Los Angeles but works at times in any one of twenty - two states . </P> <Ul> <Li> Biography portal </Li> <Li> Los Angeles portal </Li> <Li> California portal </Li> <Li> Film portal </Li> <Li> Television portal </Li> <Li> Business and Economics portal </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Full Cast and Crew for The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp '' .

If the axis passes through the body 's center of mass , the body is said to rotate upon itself , or spin .

This definition applies to rotations within both two and three dimensions ( in a plane and in space , respectively . ) </P> <P> All rigid body movements are rotations , translations , or combinations of the two . </P> <P> A rotation is simply a progressive radial orientation to a common point . That common point lies within the axis of that motion . The axis is 90 degrees perpendicular to the plane of the motion . If the axis of the rotation lies external of the body in question then the body is said to orbit . There is no fundamental difference between a `` rotation '' and an `` orbit '' and or `` spin '' . The key distinction is simply where the axis of the rotation lies , either within or outside of a body in question . This distinction can be demonstrated for both `` rigid '' and `` non rigid '' bodies . </P> <P> If a rotation around a point or axis is followed by a second rotation around the same point / axis , a third rotation results . The reverse ( inverse ) of a rotation is also a rotation . Thus , the rotations around a point / axis form a group . However , a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point / axis may result in something other than a rotation , e.g. a translation . </P> <P> Rotations around the x , y and z axes are called principal rotations . Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis , followed by a rotation around the y axis , and followed by a rotation around the z axis . That is to say , any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations . </P> <P> In flight dynamics , the principal rotations are known as yaw , pitch , and roll ( known as Tait -- Bryan angles ) . This terminology is also used in computer graphics . </P> See also : curl ( mathematics ) , cyclic permutation , Euler angles , rigid body , rotation around a fixed axis , rotation group SO ( 3 ) , rotation matrix , axis angle , quaternion , and isometry <H2> Astronomy ( edit ) </H2> Star trails caused by the Earth 's rotation during the camera 's long exposure time . <P> In astronomy , rotation is a commonly observed phenomenon . Stars , planets and similar bodies all spin around on their axes . The rotation rate of planets in the solar system was first measured by tracking visual features . Stellar rotation is measured through Doppler shift or by tracking active surface features . </P> <P> This rotation induces a centrifugal acceleration in the reference frame of the Earth which slightly counteracts the effect of gravity the closer one is to the equator . One effect is that an object weighs slightly less at the equator . Another is that the Earth is slightly deformed into an oblate spheroid . </P> <P> Another consequence of the rotation of a planet is the phenomenon of precession . Like a gyroscope , the overall effect is a slight `` wobble '' in the movement of the axis of a planet . Currently the tilt of the Earth 's axis to its orbital plane ( obliquity of the ecliptic ) is 23.44 degrees , but this angle changes slowly ( over thousands of years ) . ( See also Precession of the equinoxes and Pole star . ) </P> <H3> Rotation and revolution ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Orbital revolution <P> While revolution is often used as a synonym for rotation , in many fields , particularly astronomy and related fields , revolution , often referred to as orbital revolution for clarity , is used when one body moves around another while rotation is used to mean the movement around an axis . Moons revolve around their planet , planets revolve about their star ( such as the Earth around the Sun ) ; and stars slowly revolve about their galaxial center . The motion of the components of galaxies is complex , but it usually includes a rotation component . </P> <H3> Retrograde rotation ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Retrograde motion <P> Most planets in our solar system , including Earth , spin in the same direction as they orbit the Sun . The exceptions are Venus and Uranus . Uranus rotates nearly on its side relative to its orbit . Current speculation is that Uranus started off with a typical prograde orientation and was knocked on its side by a large impact early in its history . Venus may be thought of as rotating slowly backwards ( or being `` upside down '' ) . The dwarf planet Pluto ( formerly considered a planet ) is anomalous in this and other ways . </P> <H2> Physics ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Angular momentum See also : Speed § Tangential Speed , rotational energy , angular velocity , Centrifugal force ( fictitious ) , centripetal force , circular motion , circular orbit , Coriolis effect , spin ( physics ) , rotational spectroscopy , and Rigid body dynamics § Linear and angular momentum <P> The speed of rotation is given by the angular frequency ( rad / s ) or frequency ( turn / s , turns per minute ) , or period ( seconds , days , etc . ) . The time - rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration ( rad / s2 ) , This change is caused by torque . The ratio of the two ( how heavy is it to start , stop , or otherwise change rotation ) is given by the moment of inertia . </P> <P> The angular velocity vector ( an axial vector ) also describes the direction of the axis of rotation . Similarly the torque is an axial vector . </P> <P> The physics of the rotation around a fixed axis is mathematically described with the axis -- angle representation of rotations . According to the right - hand rule , the direction away from the observer is associated with clockwise rotation and the direction towards the observer with counterclockwise rotation , like a screw . </P> <H3> Cosmological principle ( edit ) </H3> <P> The laws of physics are currently believed to be invariant under any fixed rotation . ( Although they do appear to change when viewed from a rotating viewpoint : see rotating frame of reference . ) </P> <P> In modern physical cosmology , the cosmological principle is the notion that the distribution of matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed on a large enough scale , since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe and have no preferred direction , and should , therefore , produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang . </P> <P> In particular , for a system which behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space , its Lagrangian is rotationally invariant . According to Noether 's theorem , if the action ( the integral over time of its Lagrangian ) of a physical system is invariant under rotation , then angular momentum is conserved . </P> <H3> Euler rotations ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Euler angles Euler rotations of the Earth . Intrinsic ( green ) , Precession ( blue ) and Nutation ( red ) <P> Euler rotations provide an alternative description of a rotation . It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant . Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame , or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame , but in a mixture . They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system , where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis z , the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves . </P> <P> These rotations are called precession , nutation , and intrinsic rotation . </P> <H2> Flight dynamics ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Aircraft principal axes The principal axes of rotation in space <P> In flight dynamics , the principal rotations described with Euler angles above are known as pitch , roll and yaw . The term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch ( nose moves up ) of an aircraft , particularly when starting the climb after takeoff . </P> <P> Principal rotations have the advantage of modelling a number of physical systems such as gimbals , and joysticks , so are easily visualised , and are a very compact way of storing a rotation . But they are difficult to use in calculations as even simple operations like combining rotations are expensive to do , and suffer from a form of gimbal lock where the angles can not be uniquely calculated for certain rotations . </P> <H2> Amusement rides ( edit ) </H2> <P> Many amusement rides provide rotation . A Ferris wheel has a horizontal central axis , and parallel axes for each gondola , where the rotation is opposite , by gravity or mechanically . As a result , at any time the orientation of the gondola is upright ( not rotated ) , just translated . The tip of the translation vector describes a circle . A carousel provides rotation about a vertical axis . Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes . In Chair - O - Planes the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically , while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the centripetal force . In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles , where inertia keeps people in their seats . </P> <H2> Sports ( edit ) </H2> `` Spin move '' redirects here . For other uses , see Spin move ( disambiguation ) . <P> Rotation of a ball or other object , usually called spin , plays a role in many sports , including topspin and backspin in tennis , English , follow and draw in billiards and pool , curve balls in baseball , spin bowling in cricket , flying disc sports , etc . Table tennis paddles are manufactured with different surface characteristics to allow the player to impart a greater or lesser amount of spin to the ball . </P> <P> Rotation of a player one or more times around a vertical axis may be called spin in figure skating , twirling ( of the baton or the performer ) in baton twirling , or 360 , 540 , 720 , etc. in snowboarding , etc . Rotation of a player or performer one or more times around a horizontal axis may be called a flip , roll , somersault , heli , etc. in gymnastics , waterskiing , or many other sports , or a one - and - a-half , two - and - a-half , gainer ( starting facing away from the water ) , etc. in diving , etc . A combination of vertical and horizontal rotation ( back flip with 360 ° ) is called a möbius in waterskiing freestyle jumping . </P> <P> Rotation of a player around a vertical axis , generally between 180 and 360 degrees , may be called a spin move and is used as a deceptive or avoidance maneuver , or in an attempt to play , pass , or receive a ball or puck , etc. , or to afford a player a view of the goal or other players . It is often seen in hockey , basketball , football of various codes , tennis , etc . </P> <H2> Fixed axis vs. fixed point ( edit ) </H2> <P> The end result of any sequence of rotations of any object in 3D about a fixed point is always equivalent to a rotation about an axis . However , an object may physically rotate in 3D about a fixed point on more than one axis simultaneously , in which case there is no single fixed axis of rotation - just the fixed point . However , these two descriptions can be reconciled - such a physical motion can always be re-described in terms of a single axis of rotation , provided the orientation of that axis relative to the object is allowed to change moment by moment . </P> <H2> Axis of 2 dimensional rotations ( edit ) </H2> <P> 2 dimensional rotations , unlike the 3 dimensional ones , possess no axis of rotation . This is equivalent , for linear transformations , with saying that there is no direction in the place which is kept unchanged by a 2 dimensional rotation , except , of course , the identity . </P> <P> The question of the existence of such a direction is the question of existence of an eigenvector for the matrix A representing the rotation . Every 2D rotation ( of an angle θ ( \\ displaystyle \\ theta ) can be quite simply represented by the following matrix : </P> <Dl> <Dd> A = ( cos ⁡ θ sin ⁡ θ − sin ⁡ θ cos ⁡ θ ) ( \\ displaystyle A = ( \\ begin ( bmatrix ) \\ cos \\ theta & \\ sin \\ theta \\ \\ - \\ sin \\ theta & \\ cos \\ theta \\ end ( bmatrix ) ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> A standard eigenvalue determination leads to the characteristic polynomial λ 2 − 2 λ cos ⁡ θ + 1 = 0 ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda ^ ( 2 ) - 2 \\ lambda \\ cos \\ theta + 1 = 0 ) , which has cos ⁡ θ ± i sin ⁡ θ ( \\ displaystyle \\ cos \\ theta \\ pm i \\ sin \\ theta ) as it 's eigenvalues . Therefore , there is no real eigenvalue , meaning that no real vector in the plane is kept unchanged by A . </P> <H2> Rotation axis in 3 dimensions ( edit ) </H2> <P> Every rotation in 3D space has an axis of rotation , that is , a line which is , as a whole , kept unchanged by the rotation . </P> <P> The direction of this axis corresponds to an eigenvector of the rotation matrix A ( \\ displaystyle A ) . Therefore , the existence of such an axis corresponds to the existence of an eigenvalue of value 1 . We shall prove that there is one and only one such direction . </P> <P> The starting point of the proof it the fact that any n - dimensional matrix has n eigenvalues . It remains to determine whether these eigenvalues are distinct or not . </P> <P> The fact that A has only real coefficients imply that the complex conjugate of every complex eigenvalue is another ( different ) eigenvalue . This happens because , taking the hermitian conjugate of the eigenvalue equation A v = λ v ( \\ displaystyle Av = \\ lambda v ) , we have </P> <Dl> <Dd> v ̄ T A † = λ ∗ v ̄ T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) A ^ ( \\ dagger ) = \\ lambda ^ ( * ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) ) , </Dd> </Dl> <P> but A † ( \\ displaystyle A ^ ( \\ dagger ) ) is just the transpose A T ( \\ displaystyle A ^ ( T ) ) , so v ̄ T A T = λ ∗ v ̄ T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) A ^ ( T ) = \\ lambda ^ ( * ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) ) and we can transpose to obtain </P> <Dl> <Dd> A v ̄ = λ ∗ v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle A ( \\ bar ( v ) ) = \\ lambda ^ ( * ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> So λ ∗ ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda ^ ( * ) ) is an eigenvalue and v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) an eigenvector . </P> <P> Therefore , for every complex ( non-real ) eigenvalue , there corresponds another distinct complex eigenvalue ; it 's complex conjugate . The number of complex eigenvalue of a real matrix must then be pair . Since the rotation matrix in 3 dimensions has 3 eigenvalues , one of them must be real . Now , by the above discussion , we know that , if v is the eigenvector corresponding to this real eigenvalue , v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) must also be an eigenvector corresponding to the same eigenvalue , and therefore their sum , v + b ̄ ( \\ displaystyle v+ ( \\ bar ( b ) ) ) , is necessarily a real eigenvector . Finally , the fact that a rotation matrix is orthogonal reads , in matrix form A A T = I ( \\ displaystyle AA ^ ( T ) = I ) . Then , if we take the scalar product of A v ( \\ displaystyle Av ) with itself , we have </P> <Dl> <Dd> A v 2 = ( A v ) T A v = v T A T A v = v T v = v 2 ( \\ displaystyle Av ^ ( 2 ) = ( Av ) ^ ( T ) Av = v ^ ( T ) A ^ ( T ) Av = v ^ ( T ) v = v ^ ( 2 ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> But A v = λ v ( \\ displaystyle Av = \\ lambda v ) implies </P> <Dl> <Dd> A v 2 = λ 2 v T v = λ 2 v 2 ( \\ displaystyle Av ^ ( 2 ) = \\ lambda ^ ( 2 ) v ^ ( T ) v = \\ lambda ^ ( 2 ) v ^ ( 2 ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Hence , λ 2 = 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda ^ ( 2 ) = 1 ) . If we choose λ = − 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda = - 1 ) , this corresponds to an orthogonal matrix of determinant - 1 , that is , a rotation followed by a reflection . Choosing λ = 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda = 1 ) corresponds to a rotation . Therefore , the line in this direction v is unchanged by the rotation ; it is a rotation axis . </P> <H2> Rotation plane ( edit ) </H2> <P> As much as every tridimensional rotation has a rotation axis , also every tridimensional rotation has a plane , which is perpendicular to the rotation axis , and which is left invariant by the rotation . The rotation , restricted to this plane , is an ordinary 2D rotation . </P> <P> The proof proceeds similarly to the above discussion . First , suppose that all eigenvalues of the 3D rotation matrix A are real . This means that there is an orthogonal basis , made by the corresponding eigenvectors ( which are necessarily orthogonal ) , over which the effect of the rotation matrix is just stretching it . If we write A in this basis , it is diagonal ; but a diagonal orthogonal matrix is made of just + 1 's and - 1 's in the diagonal entries . Therefore , we do n't have a proper rotation , but either the identity or the result of a sequence of reflections . </P> <P> It follows , then , that a proper rotation has some complex eigenvalue . Let v be the corresponding eigenvector . Then , as we showed in the previous topic , v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) is also an eigenvector , and v + v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle v+ ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) and i ( v − v ̄ ) ( \\ displaystyle i ( v - ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) ) are such that their scalar product vanishes : </P> <Dl> <Dd> i ( v T + v ̄ T ) ( v − v ̄ ) = i ( v T v − v ̄ T v ̄ + v ̄ T v − v T v ̄ ) = 0 ( \\ displaystyle i ( v ^ ( T ) + ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) ) ( v - ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) = i ( v ^ ( T ) v - ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) + ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) v-v ^ ( T ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) = 0 ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> because , since v ̄ T v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) is real , it equals it 's complex conjugate v T v ( \\ displaystyle v ^ ( T ) v ) , and v ̄ T v ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ^ ( T ) v ) and v T v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle v ^ ( T ) ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) are both representations of the same scalar product between v ( \\ displaystyle v ) and v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) . </P> <P> This means v + v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle v+ ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) and i ( v − v ̄ ) ( \\ displaystyle i ( v - ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) ) are orthogonal vectors . Also , they are both real vectors by construction . These vectors span the same subspace as v ( \\ displaystyle v ) and v ̄ ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ bar ( v ) ) ) , which is an invariant subspace under the application of A. Therefore , they span an invariant plane . </P> <P> This plane is orthogonal to the invariant axis , which corresponds to the remaining eigenvector of A , with eigenvalue 1 , because of the orthogonality of the eigenvectors of A . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Absolute rotation </Li> <Li> Attitude ( geometry ) </Li> <Li> Balancing machine </Li> <Li> Circular motion </Li> <Li> Mach 's principle </Li> <Li> Rolling </Li> <Li> Rotation around a fixed axis </Li> <Li> Rotation formalisms in three dimensions </Li> <Li> Rotating locomotion in living systems </Li> <Li> Top </Li> <Li> Truck bolster </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` An Oasis , or a Secret Lair ?

His mother was Cordelia M. Kearns ( née Peterson ; 1877 -- 1962 ) , a concert pianist , from whom Kearns derived his love of music . He and his family were strict Mormons , whose ancestors were Mormon pioneers . His acting career began in 1916 when he joined ' The Rising Generation `` , a vaudeville troupe of eleven children that toured for 14 months . He briefly tried his hand at wool buying and worked for his father for a year . Kearns traveled the West as a representative of Howell , Jones and Donnell of Boston . His wool - buying career came to an abrupt end when Kearns purchased five boxcars full of black wool from a breed called Karakul for $8,000 . The problem was that black wool could not be dyed and no one knew how to use it in those days . After this fiasco , Kearns gladly gave up the wool business and pursued a show business career . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Radio ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kearns joined the staff of radio station KSL in Salt Lake City in 1930 remaining there until 1936 when he moved to Los Angeles . Kearns began his acting career in radio in the 1930s ( playing the Crazyquilt Dragon in the serial The Cinnamon Bear ) , becoming active during the 1940s , with appearances on the shows The Adventures of Sam Spade , Burns and Allen , The Whistler , and dozens of other shows . On Suspense , he was almost a mainstay , heard regularly as the host `` The Man in Black '' in the early years , announcing many episodes in the later run , and playing supporting and occasional lead roles in hundreds of shows throughout the series ' tenure in Hollywood , from judges to kindly old - timers to cowards . He also appeared on The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , playing various different characters including Professor Moriarty and even Dr. Watson . </P> <P> Kearns played Ed , the security guard for Jack Benny 's underground money vault , on The Jack Benny Program . The ' running gag ' was that Benny had kept Ed on duty at the vault 's door so long that the guard was not conversant with current events . When Benny informed him that `` The War ( World War II ) had ended , '' Ed asked whether the `` North '' or the `` South '' had won , assuming that the American Civil War was the war Benny referred to . He played numerous parts on the Benny show , including an IRS Agent . ( ' NO ONE yells at a tax collector , Mr. Benny ! `` ) He appeared in regular roles on The Mel Blanc Show ( as the cantankerous father of Mel 's on - air girl friend , Betty , played by Mary Jane Croft ) and The Harold Peary Show as Old Doc Yak - Yak . He also played numerous comedic parts on Judy Canova 's radio show , including her `` dumb boyfriend '' , Lukey . </P> <H3> Film career ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kearns made his film debut in Hard , Fast and Beautiful ( 1951 ) . He was the voice of the Doorknob in Disney 's animated film , Alice in Wonderland ( 1951 ) . Kearns appeared in other movies , making his final film appearance as the crime photographer in Anatomy of a Murder ( 1959 ) . </P> <H3> Television ( edit ) </H3> Joseph Kearns ( right ) with the cast of Dennis the Menace ( 1960 ) <P> On television , Kearns reprised his radio roles on The Jack Benny Program and also appeared with Eve Arden and Richard Crenna in Our Miss Brooks ( 1953 -- 55 ) , first as Assistant Superintendent Michaels and later ( in eight episodes ) as Superintendent Stone , a role that he had played on radio . </P> <P> He appeared on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show a total of 11 times , Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet a total of 16 times , I Love Lucy , My Little Margie , Perry Mason , I Married Joan , December Bride , It 's a Great Life , Angel , Gunsmoke , and General Electric Theater . Kearns played Fred on Professional Father . In 1959 Kearns appeared as criminologist Edward Langley in the Perry Mason episode , `` The Case of the Perjured Parrot '' . </P> Dennis the Menace ( edit ) <P> Kearns ' final role was as George Wilson , the grouchy , cantankerous neighbor in CBS 's Dennis the Menace based on the comic strip by Hank Ketcham . After his death , Kearns was replaced in the cast by Gale Gordon , who played George Wilson 's brother John . Kearns and Gordon had worked together prior to Dennis the Menace , on the old radio show The Cinnamon Bear . </P> <P> In the last episode that aired before Kearns ' death , episode 89 entitled `` Where There 's a Will '' , the story dealt with Mr. Wilson making out a will and explaining that Dennis would inherit his gold watch when he dies . The last episode Kearns filmed was titled `` The Man Next Door '' , episode 100 , and shown on May 6 , 1962 . Sylvia Field as George 's wife , Martha , remained for a few more broadcasts , with John Wilson appearing in episode 103 , `` John Wilson 's Cushion '' , which aired on May 27 , 1962 . There were references to George being ' back east ' in subsequent shows . While Kearns was still filming episodes , the show introduced Edward Everett Horton as George 's Uncle Ned , beginning with episode 90 . Horton subsequently appeared twice more . In season four , Field was replaced in the cast by Sara Seegar , playing John Wilson 's wife , Eloise . </P> <H3> Personal Life ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kearns never married nor had any children . Describing himself as a night owl who hated to get up early in the morning , Kearns enjoyed cooking , reading novels , writing , traveling , going to the movies , and playing cards in his spare time . He was a member of the exclusive Societe des Gentilhommes Chefs de Cuisine , a club for the gentlemen chefs . The members traded original recipes with other club members . Kearns also wrote plays and scripts for his various radio shows . His favorite hobby was playing the organ . Kearns , who was musically trained by his mother , had played the pipe organ for a Los Angeles theatre in the 1930s . Kearns purchased a Hammond organ and installed it in a studio apartment he designed and built in the 1940s . He later purchased a larger 26 rank Wurlizter organ that had been designed for Warner Brothers in 1929 . He then designed and built a soundproof 2 - 1 / 2 story home around the organ . Kearns delighted in playing the organ for his guests . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> <P> Kearns suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on February 11 , 1962 , during the third season of Dennis the Menace . He was hospitalized but never regained consciousness and died on February 17 , 1962 , five days after he had turned 55 . He was buried at the Forest Lawn , Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles . </P> <H2> Selected filmography ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> The Hucksters ( 1947 ) - Radio Voice ( uncredited ) </Li> <Li> Hard , Fast and Beautiful ( 1951 ) - J.R.

      "question": "who were the two mathematicians that invented calculus",
      "context": "Leibniz -- Newton calculus controversy - wikipedia <H1> Leibniz -- Newton calculus controversy </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> The calculus controversy ( often referred to with the German term Prioritätsstreit , meaning `` priority dispute '' ) was an argument between 17th - century mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz ( begun or fomented in part by their disciples and associates ) over who had first invented the mathematical study of change , calculus . It is a question that had been the cause of a major intellectual controversy , one that began simmering in 1699 and broke out in full force in 1711 . </P> <P> Newton claimed to have begun working on a form of calculus ( which he called `` the method of fluxions and fluents '' ) in 1666 , at the age of 23 , but did not publish it except as a minor annotation in the back of one of his publications decades later ( a relevant Newton manuscript of October 1666 is now published among his mathematical papers ) . Gottfried Leibniz began working on his variant of calculus in 1674 , and in 1684 published his first paper employing it , `` Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis '' . L'Hôpital published a text on Leibniz 's calculus in 1696 ( in which he recognized that Newton 's Principia of 1687 was `` nearly all about this calculus '' ) . Meanwhile , Newton , though he explained his ( geometrical ) form of calculus in Section I of Book I of the Principia of 1687 , did not explain his eventual fluxional notation for the calculus in print until 1693 ( in part ) and 1704 ( in full ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Development </Li> <Li> 3 References in fiction </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 Sources </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> The last years of Leibniz 's life , 1710 -- 1716 , were embittered by a long controversy with John Keill , Newton , and others , over whether Leibniz had discovered calculus independently of Newton , or whether he had merely invented another notation for ideas that were fundamentally Newton 's . Newton manipulated the quarrel . The most remarkable aspect of this struggle was that no participant doubted for a moment that Newton had already developed his method of fluxions when Leibniz began working on the differential calculus . Yet there was seemingly no proof beyond Newton 's word . He had published a calculation of a tangent with the note : `` This is only a special case of a general method whereby I can calculate curves and determine maxima , minima , and centers of gravity . '' How this was done he explained to a pupil a full 20 years later , when Leibniz 's articles were already well - read . Newton 's manuscripts came to light only after his death . </P> <P> The infinitesimal calculus can be expressed either in the notation of fluxions or in that of differentials , or , as noted above , it was also expressed by Newton in geometrical form , as in the Principia of 1687 . Newton employed fluxions as early as 1666 , but did not publish an account of his notation until 1693 . The earliest use of differentials in Leibniz 's notebooks may be traced to 1675 . He employed this notation in a 1677 letter to Newton . The differential notation also appeared in Leibniz 's memoir of 1684 . </P> <P> The claim that Leibniz invented the calculus independently of Newton rests on the basis that Leibniz : </P> <Ol> <Li> published a description of his method some years before Newton printed anything on fluxions ; </Li> <Li> always alluded to the discovery as being his own invention . This statement went unchallenged for some years ; </Li> <Li> enjoyed the strong presumption that he acted in good faith ; </Li> <Li> demonstrated in his private papers his development of the ideas of calculus in a manner independent of the path taken by Newton . </Li> </Ol> <P> According to Leibniz 's detractors , the fact that Leibniz 's claim went unchallenged for some years is immaterial . To rebut this case it is sufficient to show that he : </P> <Ul> <Li> saw some of Newton 's papers on the subject in or before 1675 or at least 1677 </Li> <Li> obtained the fundamental ideas of the calculus from those papers . </Li> </Ul> <P> No attempt was made to rebut # 4 , which was not known at the time , but which provides the strongest of the evidence that Leibniz came to the calculus independently from Newton . This evidence , however , is still questionable based on the discovery , in the Inquest and after , that Leibniz both back - dated and changed fundamentals of his `` original '' notes , not only in this intellectual conflict , but in several others ( he also published `` anonymous '' slanders of Newton regarding their controversy which he tried , initially , to claim he was not author of ) . Assuming good faith , however , Leibniz 's notes as presented to the inquest came first to integration , which he saw as a generalization of the summation of infinite series , whereas Newton began from derivatives . However , to view the development of calculus as entirely independent between the work of Newton and Leibniz misses the point that both had some knowledge of the methods of the other ( though Newton did develop most fundamentals before Leibniz started ) and in fact worked together on a few aspects , in particular power series , as is shown in a letter to Henry Oldenburg dated 24 October 1676 , where Newton remarks that Leibniz had developed a number of methods , one of which was new to him . Both Leibniz and Newton could see by this exchange of letters that the other was far along towards the calculus ( Leibniz in particular mentions it ) but only Leibniz was prodded thereby into publication . </P> <P> That Leibniz saw some of Newton 's manuscripts had always been likely . In 1849 , C.I. Gerhardt , while going through Leibniz 's manuscripts , found extracts from Newton 's De Analysi per Equationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas ( published in 1704 as part of the De Quadratura Curvarum but also previously circulated among mathematicians starting with Newton giving a copy to Isaac Barrow in 1669 and Barrow sending it to John Collins ) in Leibniz 's handwriting , the existence of which had been previously unsuspected , along with notes re-expressing the content of these extracts in Leibniz 's differential notation . Hence when these extracts were made becomes all - important . It is known that a copy of Newton 's manuscript had been sent to Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus in May 1675 , a time when he and Leibniz were collaborating ; it is not impossible that these extracts were made then . It is also possible that they may have been made in 1676 , when Leibniz discussed analysis by infinite series with Collins and Oldenburg . It is probable that they would have then shown him the manuscript of Newton on that subject , a copy of which one or both of them surely possessed . On the other hand , it may be supposed that Leibniz made the extracts from the printed copy in or after 1704 . Shortly before his death , Leibniz admitted in a letter to Abbé Antonio Schinella Conti , that in 1676 Collins had shown him some of Newton 's papers , but Leibniz also implied that they were of little or no value . Presumably he was referring to Newton 's letters of 13 June and 24 October 1676 , and to the letter of 10 December 1672 , on the method of tangents , extracts from which accompanied the letter of 13 June . </P> <P> Whether Leibniz made use of the manuscript from which he had copied extracts , or whether he had previously invented the calculus , are questions on which no direct evidence is available at present . It is , however , worth noting that the unpublished Portsmouth Papers show that when Newton went carefully into the whole dispute in 1711 , he picked out this manuscript as the one which had probably somehow fallen into Leibniz 's hands . At that time there was no direct evidence that Leibniz had seen Newton 's manuscript before it was printed in 1704 ; hence Newton 's conjecture was not published . But Gerhardt 's discovery of a copy made by Leibniz tends to confirm its accuracy . Those who question Leibniz 's good faith allege that to a man of his ability , the manuscript , especially if supplemented by the letter of 10 December 1672 , sufficed to give him a clue as to the methods of the calculus . Since Newton 's work at issue did employ the fluxional notation , anyone building on that work would have to invent a notation , but some deny this . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> The quarrel was a retrospective affair . In 1696 , already some years later than the events that became the subject of the quarrel , the position still looked potentially peaceful : Newton and Leibniz had each made limited acknowledgements of the other 's work , and L'Hôpital's 1696 book about the calculus from a Leibnizian point of view had also acknowledged Newton 's published work of the 1680s as `` nearly all about this calculus '' ( `` presque tout de ce calcul '' ) , while expressing preference for the convenience of Leibniz 's notation . </P> <P> At first , there was no reason to suspect Leibniz 's good faith . In 1699 , Nicolas Fatio de Duillier , a Swiss mathematician known for his work on the zodiacal light problem , accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton . It was not until the 1704 publication of an anonymous review of Newton 's tract on quadrature , a review implying that Newton had borrowed the idea of the fluxional calculus from Leibniz , that any responsible mathematician doubted that Leibniz had invented the calculus independently of Newton . With respect to the review of Newton 's quadrature work , all admit that there was no justification or authority for the statements made therein , which were rightly attributed to Leibniz . But the subsequent discussion led to a critical examination of the whole question , and doubts emerged . Had Leibniz derived the fundamental idea of the calculus from Newton ? The case against Leibniz , as it appeared to Newton 's friends , was summed up in the Commercium Epistolicum of 1712 , which referenced all allegations . This document was thoroughly machined by Newton . </P> <P> No such summary ( with facts , dates , and references ) of the case for Leibniz was issued by his friends ; but Johann Bernoulli attempted to indirectly weaken the evidence by attacking the personal character of Newton in a letter dated 7 June 1713 . When pressed for an explanation , Bernoulli most solemnly denied having written the letter . In accepting the denial , Newton added in a private letter to Bernoulli the following remarks , Newton 's claimed reasons for why he took part in the controversy . He said , `` I have never grasped at fame among foreign nations , but I am very desirous to preserve my character for honesty , which the author of that epistle , as if by the authority of a great judge , had endeavoured to wrest from me . Now that I am old , I have little pleasure in mathematical studies , and I have never tried to propagate my opinions over the world , but I have rather taken care not to involve myself in disputes on account of them . '' </P> <P> Leibniz explained his silence as follows , in a letter to Conti dated 9 April 1716 : </P> <P> In order to respond point by point to all the work published against me , I would have to go into much minutiae that occurred thirty , forty years ago , of which I remember little : I would have to search my old letters , of which many are lost . Moreover , in most cases , I did not keep a copy , and when I did , the copy is buried in a great heap of papers , which I could sort through only with time and patience . I have enjoyed little leisure , being so weighted down of late with occupations of a totally different nature . </P> <P> While Leibniz 's death put a temporary stop to the controversy , the debate persisted for many years . </P> <P> To Newton 's staunch supporters this was a case of Leibniz 's word against a number of contrary , suspicious details . His unacknowledged possession of a copy of part of one of Newton 's manuscripts may be explicable ; but it appears that on more than one occasion , Leibniz deliberately altered or added to important documents ( e.g. , the letter of 7 June 1713 in the Charta Volans , and that of 8 April 1716 in the Acta Eruditorum ) , before publishing them , and falsified a date on a manuscript ( 1675 being altered to 1673 ) . All this casts doubt on his testimony . </P> <P> Several points should be noted . Considering Leibniz 's intellectual prowess , as demonstrated by his other accomplishments , he had more than the requisite ability to invent the calculus . What he is alleged to have received was a number of suggestions rather than an account of calculus ; it is possible that since he did not publish his results of 1677 until 1684 and since differential notation was his invention , Leibniz may have minimized , 30 years later , any benefit he may have enjoyed from reading Newton 's manuscript . Moreover , he may have seen the question of who originated the calculus as immaterial when set against the expressive power of his notation . </P> <P> In any event , a bias favoring Newton tainted the whole affair from the outset . The Royal Society set up a committee to pronounce on the priority dispute , in response to a letter it had received from Leibniz . That committee never asked Leibniz to give his version of the events . The report of the committee , finding in favor of Newton , was written and published as `` Commercium Epistolicum '' ( mentioned above ) by Newton early in 1713 . But Leibniz did not see it until the autumn of 1714 . </P> <P> The prevailing opinion in the 18th century was against Leibniz ( in Britain , not in the German - speaking world ) . Today the consensus is that Leibniz and Newton independently invented and described the calculus in Europe in the 17th century . </P> <P> It was certainly Isaac Newton who first devised a new infinitesimal calculus and elaborated it into a widely extensible algorithm , whose potentialities he fully understood ; of equal certainty , differential and integral calculus , the fount of great developments flowing continuously from 1684 to the present day , was created independently by Gottfried Leibniz . </P> -- Hall 1980 : 1 <P> One author has identified the dispute as being about `` profoundly different '' methods : </P> <P> Despite ... points of resemblance , the methods ( of Newton and Leibniz ) are profoundly different , so making the priority row a nonsense . </P> -- Grattan - Guinness 1997 : 247 <P> On the other hand , other authors have emphasized the equivalences and mutual translatability of the methods : here N Guicciardini ( 2003 ) appears to confirm L'Hôpital ( 1696 ) ( already cited ) : </P> <P> the Newtonian and Leibnizian schools shared a common mathematical method . They adopted two algorithms , the analytical method of fluxions , and the differential and integral calculus , which were translatable one into the other . </P> -- Guicciardini 2003 , at page 250 <H2> References in fiction ( edit ) </H2> <P> The calculus controversy is a major topic in Neal Stephenson 's set of historical novels The Baroque Cycle ( 2003 -- 04 ) . </P> <P> The antagonistic nature of the dispute plays a role in Greg Keyes ' steampunk alternate history series The Age of Unreason . </P> <P> Briefly mentioned by Walter Bishop in the Season 1 episode of Fringe , entitled `` The Equation '' . </P> <P> It 's not so surprising actually . Curious minds often converge on the same idea . Newton and Leibniz independently , without knowing each other , invented calculus . The relevant question is what is it ? </P> <P> The controversy is referenced in the Season 3 entry of Epic Rap Battles of History featuring Isaac Newton ( portrayed by `` Weird Al '' Yankovic ) performing a rap battle against Bill Nye ( Nice Peter ) and Neil deGrasse Tyson ( Chali 2na ) . Tyson delivers a rap line stating that Newton was busy `` sticking daggers in Leibniz '' . </P> <P> In an episode of The Big Bang Theory , Leonard is accused of not wanting the bust of Isaac Newton at the top of the Christmas tree by Sheldon , saying it is because he is a Leibniz man . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Book : Isaac Newton </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> History of calculus </Li> <Li> Possibility of transmission of Kerala School results to Europe </Li> <Li> List of scientific priority disputes </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ DT Whiteside ( ed . ) , The Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton ( Volume 1 ) , ( Cambridge University Press , 1967 ) , part 7 `` The October 1666 Tract on Fluxions '' , at page 400 , in 2008 reprint . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Section I of Book I of the Principia , explaining `` the method of first and last ratios '' , a geometrical form of infinitesimal calculus , as recognized both in Newton 's time and in modern times -- see citations above by L'Hospital ( 1696 ) , Truesdell ( 1968 ) and Whiteside ( 1970 ) -- is available online in its English translation of 1729 , at page 41 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Marquis de l'Hôpital 's original words about the ' Principia ' : `` lequel est presque tout de ce calcul '' : see the preface to his Analyse des Infiniment Petits ( Paris , 1696 ) .

      "context": "Muscle relaxant - wikipedia <H1> Muscle relaxant </H1> Jump to : navigation , search This article is about skeletal muscle relaxants . For information on smooth muscle relaxants , see Antispasmodic . <P> A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone . It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms , pain , and hyperreflexia . The term `` muscle relaxant '' is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups : neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics . Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system ( CNS ) activity . They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis . Spasmolytics , also known as `` centrally acting '' muscle relaxants , are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions . While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxants , the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Neuromuscular blockers </Li> <Li> 3 Spasmolytics <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Terminology </Li> <Li> 3.2 Clinical use </Li> <Li> 3.3 Mechanism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Side effects </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The earliest known use of muscle relaxant drugs was by natives of the Amazon Basin in South America who used poison - tipped arrows that produced death by skeletal muscle paralysis . This was first documented in the 16th century , when European explorers encountered it . This poison , known today as curare , led to some of the earliest scientific studies in pharmacology . Its active ingredient , tubocurarine , as well as many synthetic derivatives , played a significant role in scientific experiments to determine the function of acetylcholine in neuromuscular transmission . By 1943 , neuromuscular blocking drugs became established as muscle relaxants in the practice of anesthesia and surgery . </P> <P> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved the use of carisoprodol in 1959 , metaxalone in August 1962 , and cyclobenzaprine in August 1977 . </P> <P> Other skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine ( anticholinergic ) , chlorzoxazone , tizanidine ( clonidine relative ) , diazepam , tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines , mephenoxalone , methocarbamol , dantrolene , baclofen , Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate , barbiturates , methaqualone , glutethimide and the like ; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties , and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and / or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products , some ketobemidone , piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic . </P> <H2> Neuromuscular blockers ( edit ) </H2> Detailed view of a neuromuscular junction : 1 . Presynaptic terminal 2 . Sarcolemma 3 . Synaptic vesicle 4 . Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 5 . Mitochondrion Main article : Neuromuscular - blocking drug <P> Muscle relaxation and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites , including the central nervous system , myelinated somatic nerves , unmyelinated motor nerve terminals , nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , the motor end plate , and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus . Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction . Normally , a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal , initiating an influx of calcium ions , which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine . Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft . It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase ( AchE ) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor end plate . The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium - potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor . This allows Na + and Ca 2 + ions to enter the cell and K + ions to leave the cell , causing a depolarization of the end plate , resulting in muscle contraction . Following depolarization , the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase . </P> <P> Normal end plate function can be blocked by two mechanisms . Nondepolarizing agents , such as tubocurarine , block the agonist , acetylcholine , from binding to nicotinic receptors and activating them , thereby preventing depolarization . Alternatively , depolarizing agents , such as succinylcholine , are nicotinic receptor agonists which mimic Ach , block muscle contraction by depolarizing to such an extent that it desensitizes the receptor and it can no longer initiate an action potential and cause muscle contraction . Both of these classes of neuromuscular blocking drugs are structurally similar to acetylcholine , the endogenous ligand , in many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked end - to - end by a rigid carbon ring system , as in pancuronium ( a nondepolarizing agent ) . </P> Chemical diagram of pancuronium , with red lines indicating the two acetylcholine `` molecules '' in the structure <H2> Spasmolytics ( edit ) </H2> Main article : antispasmodic A view of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle showing the action of various muscle relaxants -- black lines ending in arrow heads represent chemicals or actions that enhance the target of the lines , blue lines ending in squares represent chemicals or actions that inhibition the target of the line <P> The generation of the neuronal signals in motor neurons that cause muscle contractions are dependent on the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition the motor neuron receives . Spasmolytic agents generally work by either enhancing the level of inhibition , or reducing the level of excitation . Inhibition is enhanced by mimicking or enhancing the actions of endogenous inhibitory substances , such as GABA . </P> <H3> Terminology ( edit ) </H3> <P> Because they may act at the level of the cortex , brain stem or spinal cord , or all three areas , they have traditionally been referred to as `` centrally acting '' muscle relaxants . However , it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity ( e.g. dantrolene ) , so this name is inaccurate . </P> <P> Most sources still use the term `` centrally acting muscle relaxant '' . According to MeSH , dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant . The World Health Organization , in its ATC , uses the term `` centrally acting agents '' , but adds a distinct category of `` directly acting agents '' , for dantrolene . Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973 . </P> <P> The term `` spasmolytic '' is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic . </P> <H3> Clinical use ( edit ) </H3> <P> Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine , metaxalone , and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain , fibromyalgia , tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome . However , they are not recommended as first - line agents ; in acute low back pain , they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants . Nevertheless , some ( low - quality ) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs . In general , no high - quality evidence supports their use . No drug has been shown to be better than another , and all of them have adverse effects , particularly dizziness and drowsiness . Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs , especially if increased sedation is a risk , further limit their use . A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse - effect profile , tolerability , and cost . </P> <P> Muscle relaxants ( according to one study ) were not advised for orthopedic conditions , but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis . Dantrolene , although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent , is associated with CNS effects , whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS . </P> <P> Muscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain . However , considerable evidence contradicts this theory . </P> <P> In general , muscle relaxants are not approved by FDA for long - term use . However , rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly on a daily basis to increase stage 4 sleep . By increasing this sleep stage , patients feel more refreshed in the morning . Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia . </P> <P> Muscle relaxants such as tizanidine are prescribed in the treatment of tension headaches . </P> <P> Diazepam and carisoprodol are not recommended for older adults , pregnant women , or people who suffer depression or for those with a history of drug or alcohol addiction . </P> <H3> Mechanism ( edit ) </H3> <P> Because of the enhancement of inhibition in the CNS , most spasmolytic agents have the side effects of sedation , drowsiness and may cause dependence with long - term use . Several of these agents also have abuse potential , and their prescription is strictly controlled . </P> <P> The benzodiazepines , such as diazepam , interact with the GABA receptor in the central nervous system . While it can be used in patients with muscle spasm of almost any origin , it produces sedation in most individuals at the doses required to reduce muscle tone . </P> <P> Baclofen is considered to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity , and causes much less sedation . It acts as a GABA agonist at GABA receptors in the brain and spinal cord , resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor , most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance . Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically , by reducing calcium ion influx , and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord . It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord , as well . </P> <P> Clonidine and other imidazoline compounds have also been shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity . Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog , and is an agonist at α - adrenergic receptors , but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine . Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone , therefore minimizing spasticity . Furthermore , several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents , such as diazepam and baclofen , with a different spectrum of adverse effects . </P> <P> The hydantoin derivative dantrolene is a spasmolytic agent with a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS . It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation - contraction coupling in the muscle fiber . In normal muscle contraction , calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel , which causes the tension - generating interaction of actin and myosin . Dantrolene interferes with the release of calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition . Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly , although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly , most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process . Major adverse effects of dantrolene include general muscle weakness , sedation , and occasionally hepatitis . </P> <P> Other common spasmolytic agents include : methocarbamol , carisoprodol , chlorzoxazone , cyclobenzaprine , gabapentin , metaxalone , and orphenadrine . </P> <H2> Side effects ( edit ) </H2> <P> Muscle relaxants are very powerful drugs which may produce negative effects , including heart failure and paralysis . Patients most commonly report sedation as the main adverse effect of muscle relaxants . Usually , people become less alert when they are under the effects of muscle relaxant drugs . People are normally advised not to drive vehicles or operate heavy machinery while under muscle relaxants ' effects . </P> <P> Cyclobenzaprine produces confusion and lethargy , as well as anticholinergic side effects . When taken in excess or in combination with other substances , it may also be toxic . While the body adjusts to this medication , it is possible for patients to experience dry mouth , fatigue , lightheadedness , constipation or blurred vision . Some serious but unlikely side effects may be experienced , including mental or mood changes , possible confusion and hallucinations , and difficulty urinating . In a very few cases , very serious but rare side effects may be experienced : irregular heartbeat , yellowing of eyes or skin , fainting , abdominal pain including stomachache , nausea or vomiting , lack of appetite , seizures , dark urine , or loss of coordination . </P> <P> Patients taking carisoprodol for a prolonged time have reported dependence , withdrawal and abuse , although most of these cases were reported by patients who had had a history of addiction . These effects were also reported by patients who took it in combination with other drugs with abuse potential , and in fewer cases , there were reports of carisoprodol - associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential . </P> <P> Common side effects eventually caused by metaxalone include dizziness , headache , drowsiness , nausea , irritability , nervousness , upset stomach and vomiting . Severe side effects may be experienced when consuming metaxalone , such as severe allergic reactions ( rash , hives , itching , difficulty breathing , tightness in the chest , swelling of the mouth , face , lips , or tongue ) , chills , fever , and sore throat , may require medical attention . Other severe side effects include unusual or severe tiredness or weakness , as well as yellowing of the skin or the eyes . When baclofen is administered intrathecally , it may cause CNS depression accompanied with cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure . Tizanidine may lower blood pressure . This effect can be controlled by administering a low dose at the beginning and increasing it gradually . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Paralysis </Li> <Li> Quaternary ammonium muscle relaxants </Li> <Li> Caroverine </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Definition of Muscle relaxant .

Dusty has also remarried , this time to Karen , a writer , and is stepdad to Adrianna , Karen 's daughter . </P> <P> Brad and his wife , Sara , along with Dusty and Karen , attend a school play for Megan , where she announces to the whole audience that she does n't like the fact that she has to go back and forth to different houses all the time . Back at the house , after the play , Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases and instead do one `` together Christmas '' . Dusty , however , finds out his tough fighter pilot / astronaut father Kurt ( Mel Gibson ) is coming for Christmas . </P> <P> At the airport the next day , Dusty tells Brad that his father is going to make fun of them since he wo n't understand their co-dad arrangement . When Kurt arrives , he mistakes Brad for a chauffeur . When Dusty explains that Brad is the stepdad to his children , Kurt does n't like it . Brad 's overbearing and over-cheerful dad , Don , arrives next , unnerving Kurt . Don tells Brad that his mother did n't come along , because she is taking care of Brad 's Uncle who is n't feeling well . </P> <P> Back at the house , Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don , since he is very present in their lives , while Kurt has n't seen the children since they were toddlers . Kurt rents a large cabin through Airbnb , to house all of them through the holiday week . As Brad and Dusty pack the bags into the car , Dusty tells Brad that Kurt thinks the two men are harboring bad feelings for each other , but are just hiding it from everyone by pretending to be friends . When Kurt comes up , they change the subject . </P> <P> Throughout the week , Brad and Dusty 's co-dad relationship is put to the test by Kurt 's meddling . Meanwhile , Dusty tries to get close to his stepdaughter , Adrianna , but she does n't like him and repeatedly tells him that he is n't her father . Sara also tries to bond with Karen but is taken aback by some of Karen 's actions , like shoplifting clothes from a store . Dylan develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door . He gets made fun of it by Megan and Adrianna . </P> <P> The next day , the family goes out to take the kids to see Santa . While there , Kurt convinces Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun , which he does ask for . Brad and Sara tell Dylan that a shotgun for hunting means that a poor innocent animal will lose its life . This convinces Dylan to change his mind , but Megan instead decides she wants to go hunting . While out hunting the next day , Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder , sending him to the hospital . </P> <P> At the hospital , Dusty and Kurt begin to bond after they almost begin fighting when Kurt tries to leave the hospital . That night , Brad , Dusty , Don & Kurt go to an improv comedy club where the four men are relaxing and having a good time watching the show . Kurt gets up to go get another drink at the bar . Dusty sees Kurt picking up a woman at the bar and leaves with her . Brad enters Don into the improv show , and Dusty chooses a topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of an improv skit . As the skit progresses , it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife in real life . The audience believes that this is all part of the show , even when Brad tries to tell the audience that it is not . </P> <P> The next day , Brad confronts Dusty . After Dusty reveals that he chose the infidelity subject for the improv game because he wanted to get back at Brad , because of how Brad has a good relationship with Don . Brad says he knows that is why Dusty chose that particular topic and to get back at Dusty ; Brad has invited Adrianna 's real dad , Roger , to the cabin for Christmas . </P> <P> That evening , the entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation . Brad gets into a fight with Dusty after Brad wants to play Joseph , which Dusty is currently playing . This breaks out in front of a crowd that is watching . Instead of Dusty fighting Brad , he almost comes to blows with Roger . </P> <P> The next morning , Christmas Day , the families all pack up to leave . On their way out of town , the families are forced back to town on account of a blizzard . They are forced to take shelter at a movie theater . With every other movie being sold out , due to the huge influx of business from other families seeking shelter at the theater , both families go to see the last movie available : Missile Tow , a fictitious Liam Neeson holiday action film . </P> <P> When the power cuts off during the movie , the families go to the lobby where each man confronts their father about the secrets , lies , and attitudes . Don confronts Brad about not telling him the truth about his divorce , while Dusty tries to talk to Kurt . When Dylan sees the girl he has a crush on , is also there at the theater , he is teased again by Megan and Adrianna . After remembering some advice given to him by Kurt , Dylan walks toward her to kiss her . All of a sudden , he does n't kiss her , but instead kisses Adrianna , his stepsister . Roger gets freaked out and attempts to leave with Adrianna , but is confronted by Dusty . He deduces that the reason why Adrianna has n't warmed up to him is that he has never told her that he loves her , which he does . He also tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family . Roger almost leaves without Adrianna , but has a change of heart after everyone breaks out into a song of Do They Know It 's Christmas ? and decides to stay . Don and Brad also reconcile . </P> <P> Sometime later , at the airport , Don and Kurt are preparing to leave to head back to their respective homes . Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators , where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they 're going to spend New Years in Las Vegas . </P> <P> As Brad 's mom 's flight arrives , Dusty and Brad discover that Brad 's new stepdad is Chesley `` Sully '' Sullenberger , the pilot of the `` Miracle on the Hudson '' flight . Brad and Dusty remember that they watched the film `` Sully '' together not too long ago and Brad appears to be welcoming towards him . Brad runs down the terminal and says that Sully will never replace his father , because Sully has only one great personal story , whereas his father has thousands of stories . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Will Ferrell as Brad Whitaker </Li> <Li> Mark Wahlberg as Dusty Mayron </Li> <Li> Mel Gibson as Kurt Mayron </Li> <Li> John Lithgow as Don Whitaker </Li> <Li> Linda Cardellini as Sara Whitaker </Li> <Li> John Cena as Roger </Li> <Li> Scarlett Estevez as Megan Mayron </Li> <Li> Owen Vaccaro as Dylan Mayron </Li> <Li> Alessandra Ambrosio as Karen Mayron </Li> <Li> Didi Costine as Adrianna </Li> <Li> Chesley Sullenberger as himself </Li> <Li> Liam Neeson as himself </Li> <Li> Bill Burr as Jerry </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> In April 2016 , the sequel was announced , with Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg reprising their roles , Sean Anders and John Morris writing the script , and Anders directing .

'' Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 1 out of 4 stars , saying : `` After enduring last week 's lousy and lazy A Bad Moms Christmas , I would have bet it would be many a year before we 'd see another holiday comedy more sour and cynical and profoundly unfunny . I sit corrected . '' </P> <P> Glenn Kenny of RogerEbert.com gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars , writing , `` I found the sequel better than the original -- the writing sharper , the jokes fresher and smarter , the comic interaction between the lead characters consistently engaging . I mentioned this to my incredulous wife , who said , ' So you 're saying it 's the Godfather , Part 2 of the Daddy 's Home series ' .

The series follows the life of Melinda Gordon ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) , who has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts . While trying to live as normal a life as possible -- she is married and owns an antique store -- Melinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the Light , or the spirit world . Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and disbelieve her ability . In addition , the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing in the beginning and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirit 's needs and help them . </P> <P> Ghost Whisperer 's fourth season aired in the United States ( U.S. ) on Fridays at 8 : 00 pm ET on CBS , a terrestrial television network , where it received an average of 10.62 million viewers per episode , becoming the most watched season of the series . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Development </Li> <Li> 3 Cast </Li> <Li> 4 Episodes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the fourth season , Melinda meets Eli James ( Jamie Kennedy ) after a fire at Rockland University who , after his own near - death experience , develops the ability to hear ghosts . Melinda says goodbye to her close friend Rick Payne , who leaves Grandview on a research trip for the university . In this season , Jim is shot and killed . He does not `` cross over '' because he does not want to leave Melinda , and his spirit later enters the body of a man named Sam Lucas , who died in an unrelated accident in Grandview and crossed over . When Jim / Sam regains consciousness , he has no memory of being Jim . Melinda works to get him to remember his past life and her , and succeeds after much difficulty and skepticism on the part of her friends . They soon discover that Melinda is pregnant and that the date of conception was right before Jim died . </P> <P> At the end of the season , Ned and Eli find the Book of Changes , a book written by the Watchers ( a benevolent group of ghosts who keep watch over the living ) . The book tells them of past and future prominent dates , such as Andrea and Jim 's deaths . One date is listed as September 25 , 2009 ; Melinda 's due date . Melinda learns from a Watcher named Carl that her child is destined to not only inherit her gift , but be far more powerful than her . Melinda and Jim decide to remarry and have a small ceremony on a snowy night , on the street where they first met . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ghost Whisperer is based on the work of `` Spirit Communicator '' James Van Praagh , who is co-executive producer and regularly updates a blog about the show through LivingTV . The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of `` Spirit Communicator '' Mary Ann Winkowski . Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere . </P> <P> The show was produced by Sander / Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios ( originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios ( originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons ) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three ) . </P> <P> The show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles . One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future trilogy , though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview . For example , the clock tower in Back to the Future has been completely covered up . Cast and crew members believe that the set gets visits from real spirits . </P> <P> Sound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound . Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works . Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX . </P> <P> Creator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn , New York , which is not far from Grandview - On - Hudson , west of the Hudson River . Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town , which is accurate to real life as Grandview - On - Hudson is actually located just north of Piermont . Professor Rick Payne worked in the fictional `` Rockland University , '' and perhaps not coincidentally , the actual Grandview , New York is a village located in Rockland County , New York . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Ghost Whisperer characters <Ul> <Li> Jennifer Love Hewitt as Melinda Gordon ( 23 episodes ) </Li> <Li> David Conrad as Jim Clancy / Sam Lucas ( 23 episodes ) </Li> <Li> Camryn Manheim as Delia Banks ( 23 episodes ) </Li> <Li> Jay Mohr as Rick Payne ( 1 episode ) </Li> <Li> Christoph Sanders as Ned Banks ( 13 episodes ) </Li> <Li> Jamie Kennedy as Eli James ( 23 episodes ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Ghost Whisperer episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th> No. in Series </Th> <Th> No. in Season </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Directed by </Th> <Th> Written by </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> U.S. viewers ( millions ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 63 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` Firestarter '' </Td> <Td> Eric Laneuville </Td> <Td> P.K.

This makes the song , in its initial studio form , impossible to perform live without additional backup singers . Instead , Decker often performs what she calls a `` basic '' version , explaining to Songfacts : `` I rap the first two verses then cut to the melody for the verse before the chorus . No one really notices or minds as I cover the essential dynamics of the song . It works well .

David Robinson won the award in the 1991 -- 92 NBA season . Gary Payton is the only point guard to win the award . Dwight Howard has won the award three consecutive times in his career . <P> The NBA 's Defensive Player of the Year Award is an annual National Basketball Association ( NBA ) award given since the 1982 -- 83 NBA season to the best defensive player of the regular season . The winner is selected by a panel of 124 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada , each of whom casts a vote for first , second and third place selections . Each first - place vote is worth five points , second - place voted are worth three points , and a third - place vote is worth one . The player with the highest point total , regardless of the number of first - place votes , wins the award . </P> <P> Since its inception , the award has been given to 21 different players . Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace have each won the award a record four times . Dwight Howard is the only player to ever win the award in three consecutive seasons . Sidney Moncrief , Mark Eaton , Dennis Rodman , Hakeem Olajuwon , Alonzo Mourning , and Kawhi Leonard have each won it twice . The most recent award recipient is Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors . </P> <P> Although five of the first six winners were perimeter players , the award has traditionally been given to big men who rebound and block shots . Only seven perimeter players have been honored : Moncrief , Alvin Robertson , Michael Cooper , Michael Jordan , Gary Payton , Ron Artest ( known now as Metta World Peace ) , and Kawhi Leonard . Payton is the only point guard to have won . Jordan , Olajuwon , David Robinson , and Kevin Garnett are the only Defensive Player of the Year winners to have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award ( MVP ) during their careers ; Jordan and Olajuwon won both awards in the same season . In Olajuwon 's case , he is the only one to have also won the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA championship in the same season . On four occasions , the Defensive Player of the Year recipient was not voted to the NBA All - Defensive First Team in the same year . Robertson in 1986 , Mutombo ( 1995 ) , Tyson Chandler ( 2012 ) , and Marc Gasol ( 2013 ) were instead named to the second team . Whereas the Defensive Player of the Year is voted on by the media , the All - Defensive teams were voted on by NBA coaches prior to 2014 . </P> <P> No player trained completely outside the U.S. has won this award . Out of the three winners born outside the U.S. , Mutombo and Olajuwon both played U.S. college basketball , and Gasol played U.S. high school basketball . Joakim Noah has played for the France national basketball team , but was born in New York City , and played both high school and college basketball in the U.S. </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide

It runs roughly north - south down the middle of the Cotentin peninsula from Valognes to the junction with the Douve at Beuzeville la Bastille . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Hydrology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The river has relatively high turbidity and its brownish water is somewhat low in velocity due to the slight gradient of the watercourse ; pH levels have been measured at 8.31 near the Chateau d'Isle Marie and electrical conductivity of the waters have tested at 61 micro-siemens per centimetre . At this reference location , summer flows are typically in the range of 250 cubic feet per second ( 7.1 m / s ) . </P> <H2> Airborne landings on D - Day ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Mission Boston <P> Running parallel to the shoreline about 5 miles ( 8.0 km ) from Utah Beach , the marshes of the Merderet and Douve formed a natural defensive line protecting the western end of the Allied landing zone and at the same time limiting the Allies ' potential to break out of the beachhead . Thus control of the bridges at Manoir de la Fière and Chef - du - Pont was seen as vital . The Merderet was assigned to the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division as Mission Boston , scheduled for 5 hours before the amphibious landings on D - Day . Cloud cover and German fire caused the landings to be dispersed ; the paratroopers took the strategic town of Sainte - Mère - Église but failed in their original mission to clear the west bank of the Merderet on D - Day and blow the bridge over the Douze at Pont l'Abbé ( now Étienville ) . The extent of their control of the bridges over the Merderet is disputed , but it was sufficient to hold off German counterattacks . These included an attack over the causeway at La Fiere by the 1057th Grenadier Regiment and light tanks of the 100th Panzer Replacement Battalion . This appears to have been the inspiration for the climactic battle in the film Saving Private Ryan , which is set around a bridge over the Merderet in the fictional town of Ramelle . </P> <P> After the Battle of Carentan on 9 June , Allied forces moved up the Cotentin Peninsula on either side of the Merderet . This advance culminated in the Battle of Cherbourg which saw the port captured by the end of the month . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Atlas des Routes de France , Solar Press : Donnees IGN ( 2007 ) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hogan , C.

Some reliable sesamoid bones such as the pisiform are counted , while others , such as the hallux sesamoids , are not . </P> <P> Individuals may have more or fewer bones than this owing to anatomical variations . The most common variations include sutural ( wormian ) bones , which are located along the sutural lines on the back of the skull , and sesamoid bones which develop within some tendons , mainly in the hands and feet .

Several occupied vehicles were crushed underneath , which resulted in six deaths and nine injuries . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Bridge layout </Li> <Li> 3 Bridge construction and design </Li> <Li> 4 Collapse <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Reports of cracking </Li> <Li> 4.2 Collapse </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 6 Inquiry </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> The FIU Sweetwater UniversityCity pedestrian Bridge , located just west of the intersection of Tamiami Trail ( Southwest 8th Street ) and Southwest 109th Avenue , was planned to connect the FIU campus to student housing neighborhoods in Sweetwater . It was intended to improve pedestrian safety , as the busy crosswalks at this wide , busy intersection had been identified as a safety hazard and the site of fatal collisions . The $14.2 million project was funded with a $19.4 million Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery ( TIGER ) grant from the United States Department of Transportation in 2013 , along with state agencies . The bridge itself cost $9 million to construct . </P> <P> The main companies behind the construction project are Munilla Construction Management ( MCM ) , a Miami - based construction management firm , and FIGG Bridge Engineers , a Tallahassee - based firm . Unlike most bridges in Florida , the design for this project was overseen by the university itself , not the Florida Department of Transportation . </P> <P> Florida International University is known for its expertise in accelerated bridge construction , and has attracted international scholars as PhD students . It is home to the federally - funded Accelerated Bridge Construction University Transportation Center , which sponsors industry conferences and seminars . </P> <H2> Bridge layout ( edit ) </H2> Elevation Engineering Drawing of Proposed FIU Sweetwater Pedestrian Bridge <P> The full 320 - foot - long ( 98 m ) pedestrian bridge was to cross both a major roadway and a parallel water canal with two separate spans connected at a faux cable - stay tower . The main , roadway - crossing span was 175 ft long , the shorter canal span was to be 99 ft long . An elevator and stairs at the south end added 31 ft , and at the north end , 15 feet , for a total bridge length of 320 feet . At the bridge site , the Tamiami Trail roadway has six lanes of traffic plus two turn lanes . The main span was rolled into place and set on support columns on March 10 , five days before the collapse . The canal span , access ramps , and faux cable - stay tower had not yet been built . Pedestrian use was to begin when the whole project was complete . The school was on spring break at the time of collapse . The section of the bridge that collapsed weighed 950 short tons ( 860 metric tons ) and fell onto several vehicles on the roadway below . </P> <H2> Bridge construction and design ( edit ) </H2> <P> Construction of the bridge began in March 2016 and was scheduled to be completed in December 2018 . The bridge 's main span was assembled adjacent to the highway using accelerated bridge construction ( ABC ) , a technique promoted at the university . It was lifted into place on the morning of March 10 , five days before the collapse , during a weekend closure of the highway . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> FIU - Sweetwater UniversityCity Bridge </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Coordinates </Th> <Td> 25 ° 45 ′ 40 '' N 80 ° 22 ′ 22 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 25.7612 ° N 80.3728 ° W ﻿ / 25.7612 ; - 80.3728 Coordinates : 25 ° 45 ′ 40 '' N 80 ° 22 ′ 22 '' W ﻿ / ﻿ 25.7612 ° N 80.3728 ° W ﻿ / 25.7612 ; - 80.3728 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Carries </Th> <Td> Pedestrian traffic </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Crosses </Th> <Td> Tamiami Trail </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Locale </Th> <Td> University Park and Sweetwater , Florida , U.S. </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Characteristics </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Total length </Th> <Td> 320 feet ( 98 m ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Longest span </Th> <Td> 175 feet ( 53 m ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> History </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Engineering design by </Th> <Td> FIGG Bridge Engineers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Constructed by </Th> <Td> Munilla Construction Management </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Construction cost </Th> <Td> $14.2 million </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Collapsed </Th> <Td> March 15 , 2018 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> University Park Location in Florida University Park University Park ( the US ) Show map of Florida Show map of the US Show all </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The new pedestrian bridge was designed to connect the campus to student housing in a dramatic sculptural way , and also to showcase the school 's leadership in the ABC method of rapid bridge construction . </P> <P> The bridge was a post-tensioned concrete structure . Concrete structures are generally 10 times heavier than equivalent steel designs . The bridge was made using a new formulation for concrete intended to stay cleaner than standard concrete formulations.In the main bridge span , the concrete floor deck , roof , and diagonal struts each contained post-tensioning cables whose compressive effect on the concrete could be adjusted after the concrete was cured . Adjustments were expected each time the span was moved onto a different foundation with different support points . </P> <P> The full bridge project was styled to look like a cable - stayed bridge with pylon tower and high cables for dramatic effect . But functionally and structurally it was actually a truss bridge , with the spans being fully self - supporting . The bridge spans used a novel concrete truss design invented for this project , a `` re-invented I - beam concept '' . Concrete truss bridges are rarely constructed , and few exist . The vertical web of the beam was a series of triangulated concrete diagonal struts along the centerline , and the diagonal angles of the struts varied across the bridge so they would align with pipes from the center pylon , in the eventual faux cable - stayed appearance . A specification change late in the project required moving the bridge 's main pylon tower 11 feet ( 3 meters ) north to allow for future highway widening , increasing the gap between the bridge end supports and requiring some new structural design . </P> <P> The concrete walkway deck was to act as the horizontal bottom flange of a wide I - beam , and the concrete roof canopy was to function as the horizontal top flange of the I - beam . The walkway was thus nearer to ground level than in a standard design where the walkway is placed on top of the structural support system . This reduced the number of steps to climb . The deck carries the entire weight of the bridge span , as a tension load . </P> <P> The canopy carries the structure 's main compressive loads . The diagonal struts carry either compression or tension forces , depending on their angle and position . The struts contain post-tensioning rods that connect the flanges , and are adjusted as needed . VSL was the company contracted for the post tensioning ( PT ) of the new bridge . Post-tensioning of a diagonal member may be one of the reasons for the structural failure of the FIU bridge . Concrete is much more prone to crack than steel in trusses . Certain cracks could compromise the cable / rod anchorings , making failure inevitable when the post-tensioning operation began . </P> <P> The bridge was meant to last more than 100 years , and to withstand a Category 5 hurricane , according to a statement by the university . </P> <H2> Collapse ( edit ) </H2> Schematic of the bridge . Green : collapsed parts , Blue : not installed at the time of the collapse . The diagonal beam that was undergoing post-tension cable / rod adjustment at the time of the collapse is highlighted in red . <H3> Reports of cracking ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 13 , the third day after lifting of the main span , the project 's lead engineer discovered cracks at the north end of the span ( the end that later broke ) . He reported this by voicemail to a Florida Department of Transportation ( FDOT ) employee . He thought this was not an immediate safety issue , merely something that would need to be repaired later . The FDOT recipient was away for several days and did not hear this message until the day after the collapse . </P> <P> At 9 a.m. on March 15 , a university employee heard a loud `` whip cracking '' sound while under the bridge span , waiting for a red traffic light . At the same time , the design - build team met for about two hours at the construction site to discuss the cracks discovered on March 13 . Representatives from both FIU and the FDOT were present . The FIGG lead engineer 's conclusions were that the structural integrity of the bridge was not compromised and that there were no safety concerns raised by the presence of the crack . </P> <P> The mayor of Miami - Dade County , Carlos A. Giménez , said that workers conducted a stress test on the morning of March 15 . </P> <H3> Collapse ( edit ) </H3> <P> At 1 : 47 p.m. , the north end of the installed bridge span sagged deeply as the first diagonal fractured , folded , and immediately dropped the heavy full span onto the roadway below . A surveillance video shows the collapse sequence took only a few video frames . </P> <P> United States Senator and FIU adjunct professor Marco Rubio tweeted that engineers were tightening loosened cables on March 15 : Workers were adding more tension to the steel rod ( tendon ) inside a concrete diagonal strut at the north end . The National Transportation Safety Board , who are investigating the collapse , stated that crews were applying `` post-tensioning force '' on the bridge before the collapse . </P> The tensioning rod that was being tightened at the time of the collapse , with a hydraulic tensioning machine ( blue ) still attached to its end , extends from the canopy in the upper left of this image . <P> At this time , it is not clear why the post-tensioning operation by VSL company was being carried out at the time of the collapse as the bridge diagonal member support they were working on would have already been in compression . The bottom joint of diagonal member # 11 ( which contains the anchor nut for the post-tensioning rod ) apparently failed explosively , during the post-tensioning operation , causing the bridge to collapse . Currently , it remains unknown why the joint may have failed , although post-tensioning remains a possible contributor . </P> <P> The span that collapsed weighed 950 short tons ( 861 tonnes ) . </P> <P> At the time of the collapse , the roadway was open and there were multiple cars stopped at a traffic light under the span . A driver who survived the collapse reported small rocks fell onto her car just before the car got smashed . A worker saved himself when he heard cracking and locked his safety harness just before the collapse . Eight cars were reported to have been crushed . Six people were killed and nine others were injured ; while early reports said that the death toll was expected to rise , authorities said on March 18 that all bodies had been accounted for . Five of the victims were killed immediately when the bridge fell ; one died at the hospital . An employee of VSL , Navaro Brown , 37 , worked for the company contracted to apply post-tensioning and died in the collapse . Two other employees of the company were hospitalized . The other deceased victims of the tragedy were identified as Alberto Arias , 53 , Brandon Brownfield , 39 , FIU student Alexa Duran , 18 , Rolando Fraga , 60 , and Oswaldo Gonzalez , 57 . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <P> On March 16 , the Florida Highway Patrol announced Southwest 8th Street between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues and the eastbound Southwest 8th Street exit from the Homestead Extension of Florida 's Turnpike would be closed indefinitely while debris removal and investigations were conducted . Debris from the bridge was cleared by March 24 , allowing Southwest 8th Street to be reopened . A team of 15 people from the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) began their investigation on the morning of March 16 . On March 19 , 2018 the first civil lawsuit was filed against Figg Bridge Engineers , MCM , Bolton Perez & Associates , the project 's consulting engineer , Louis Berger , and Network Engineering Services for reckless negligence . </P> <H2> Inquiry ( edit ) </H2> Members of the NTSB 's Go Team for the investigation boarding an FAA plane to travel to Miami . <P> On March 15 , 2018 the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) launched a Go - team to investigate the bridge collapse incident . The accident number assigned is HWY18MH009 . On March 16 , 2018 the NTSB Investigators held their first press conference to discuss the inquiry into the bridge collapse . Noteworthy points from the meeting included a statement that the inquiry was in the very early stages , that cracks in the bridge superstructure did not necessarily make the bridge unsafe , that on - site investigations would take about a week , that preserving perishable evidence was crucial , and that bridge workers were applying a `` post-tensioning force '' on the bridge before the failure . On March 21 , 2018 the NTSB sent out the following press release : </P> <P> Investigators secured a contract Tuesday to have a company remove components from the bridge that we believe warrant additional examination and testing . These components include sections of the floor , the canopy , a vertical member and a diagonal member ; all from the north end of the structure . These components were in the area of where the failure occurred . In addition to these components , we obtained additional core samples from this area to supplement the core samples we obtained earlier . Shipping the core samples along with some recovered rebar and tensioning rods to the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center , in McLean , Virginia , for testing and evaluation . The investigative team has obtained an exemplar tensioning rod and hydraulic unit used by the construction crew to make tension adjustments to the tensioning rods . These items are also being shipped to the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center for evaluation and testing . The larger bridge components the investigative team is removing , are being stored at a secured Florida Department of Transportation facility , under the control of the NTSB . The additional examinations and forensic deconstruction of these components will occur there . The investigative team has confirmed that workers were adjusting tension on the two tensioning rods located in the diagonal member at the north end of the span when the bridge collapsed . They had done this same work earlier at the south end , moved to the north side , and had adjusted one rod . They were working on the second rod when the span failed and collapsed . The roadway was not closed while this work was being performed . </P> <P> On March 21 , 2018 U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao asked the department 's inspector general to probe whether a federally funded UniversityCity pedestrian bridge complied with all rules . A subsequent internal memorandum from the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation , dated March 22 , 2018 included the following statements : </P> <P> The Florida International University pedestrian bridge was funded in part through the Department of Transportation 's ( DOT ) Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery ( TIGER ) discretionary grant program. 1 The Federal Highway Administration administered the grant funds for the project . On March 19 , the Secretary of Transportation requested that we initiate an audit to evaluate whether the project complied with Federal requirements and specifications . On March 20 , Senator Bill Nelson , Ranking Member of the Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation , requested that we also review the implementation and oversight roles of all parties on the project . We share these concerns about the collapse , and we are committed to supporting the Department 's efforts to improve transportation safety . Accordingly , the objective of our audit will be to assess whether the Florida International University pedestrian bridge met Federal and DOT requirements for the TIGER application , approval , and grant agreement processes . </P> <P> On March 28 , 2018 the Miami Herald reported they were denied access to FIU documents related to the bridge construction , citing federal regulations that prevent release of non-public information related to the bridge construction and design project when an NTSB investigation is in progress . A lawyer for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press indicated more information should be released under the Florida Sunshine Law , due to intense public interest in the collapse . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of bridge failures </Li> <Li> List of structural failures and collapses </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Viglucci , Andres ; Madan , Monique O. ; Hanks , Douglas ; Chang , Daniel ( March 15 , 2018 ) . `` At least 4 dead in catastrophic FIU pedestrian bridge collapse ; 9 rescued from rubble '' .

The league is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the team that is top of the league at the end of the season . La Liga , first established in 1929 , originally contained ten teams . Before La Liga 's organization , the Copa del Rey -- a regionalised cup competition -- was effectively the national championship . La Liga is contested in by 20 teams ; the three lowest - placed teams are relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top three teams in that division . Of the founding teams in La Liga , only Real Madrid , Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao have not been relegated . The league was cancelled between 1936 and 1939 because of the Spanish Civil War . </P> <P> Real Madrid is the most successful club with 33 titles . The most recent club other than Real Madrid and Barcelona to win the league is Atlético Madrid in the 2013 -- 14 season . With their 30 May Copa del Rey defeat of Athletic Bilbao , Barcelona has won the Spanish version of The Double the most times , having won the league and cup in the same year six times in its history , breaking its tie with Athletic 's five . Barcelona is the only Spanish team that has won the Treble , which includes the UEFA Champions League along with the league and Copa del Rey , and the only UEFA club to have won the treble twice after accomplishing that feat in 2015 .

      "question": "who gave the famous objective co relative theory",
      "context": "Objective correlative - wikipedia <H1> Objective correlative </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> An objective correlative is a literary term referring to an objective as well symbolic article used to correlate explicit , rather than implicit , access to traditionally inexplicable concepts such as emotion or color . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Theory </Li> <Li> 2 Origin of terminology </Li> <Li> 3 Criticisms </Li> <Li> 4 Examples </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Theory ( edit ) </H2> <P> The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot , who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics . Helping define the objective correlative , Eliot 's essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , republished in his book The Sacred Wood : Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare 's incomplete development of Hamlet 's emotions in the play Hamlet . Eliot uses Lady Macbeth 's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative : `` The artistic ' inevitability ' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion ... . '' , as a contrast to Hamlet . According to Eliot , the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him . The objective correlative 's purpose is to express the character 's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory : An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as `` ... perhaps little more than the ancient distinction ( first made by Plato ) between mimesis and diegesis ... . '' ( 28 ) . According to Formalist critics , this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author 's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work . The `` occasion '' of E. Montale is a further form of correlative . </P> <H2> Origin of terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The term was first coined by the American painter and poet Washington Allston ( 1779 - 1843 ) , was introduced by T.S. Eliot , rather casually , into his essay `` Hamlet and His Problems '' ( 1919 ) ; its subsequent vogue in literary criticism , Eliot said , astonished him . In `` Hamlet and His Problems '' , Eliot used the term exclusively to refer to his claimed artistic mechanism whereby emotion is evoked in the audience : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding an `` objective correlative '' ; in other words , a set of objects , a situation , a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion ; such that when the external facts , which must terminate in sensory experience , are given , the emotion is immediately evoked . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> It seems to be in deference to this principle that Eliot famously described the play Hamlet as `` most certainly an artistic failure '' : Eliot felt that Hamlet 's strong emotions `` exceeded the facts '' of the play , which is to say they were not supported by an `` objective correlative '' . He acknowledged that such a circumstance is `` something which every person of sensibility has known '' ; but felt that in trying to represent it dramatically , `` Shakespeare tackled a problem which proved too much for him '' . </P> <H2> Criticisms ( edit ) </H2> <P> One possible criticism of Eliot 's theory includes his assumption that an author 's intentions concerning expression will be understood in one way only . This point is stated by Balachandra Rajan as quoted in David A. Goldfarb 's `` New Reference Works in Literary Theory '' with these words : `` Eliot argues that there is a verbal formula for any given state of emotion which , when found and used , will evoke that state and no other . '' </P> <H2> Examples ( edit ) </H2> <P> A famous haiku by Yosa Buson entitled , The Piercing Chill I Feel illustrates the use of objective correlative within poetry : </P> <P> The piercing chill I feel : </P> <P> my dead wife 's comb , in our bedroom , </P> under my heel ... <P> In the Clint Eastwood movie Jersey Boys , songwriter Bob Gaudio of The 4 Seasons is asked who the girl is in his song Cry For Me . He makes reference to T.S. Eliot 's topic , `` the Objective Correlative '' , as the subject being every girl , or any girl . In adherence to this reference , the author allows himself the literary license to step outside the scope of his personal experience , and to conjecture about the emotions and responses inherent with the situation , and utilize the third party perspective in the first party presentation . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Affect </Li> <Li> Pathetic fallacy </Li> <Li> Thing theory </Li> </Ul> <H2> Footnotes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ ( 1 ) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Eliot , T.S. `` '' Hamlet and His Problems .

She is about to head to college in the fall . However , when her mother goes on a vacation to Australia with her boyfriend , Sue Ellen looks forward to an entire summer of freedom with her siblings : slacker / drug addict Kenny ( Keith Coogan ) , 14 - year - old ladies ' man Zach ( Christopher Pettiet ) , 13 - year - old tomboy Melissa ( Danielle Harris ) , and 11 - year - old TV fanatic Walter ( Robert Hy Gorman ) . Much to Sue Ellen 's dismay , her mother hires a live - in babysitter , Mrs. Sturak , a seemingly sweet , humble old woman who assures Mrs. Crandell that she can take care of all five children . As soon as Mrs. Crandell leaves , Mrs. Sturak shows her true colors as an evil tyrant , quickly drawing the ire of the children . However , she later dies of a heart attack . When her body is discovered by Sue Ellen , the children agree to stuff the babysitter in a trunk and drop her off at a local funeral home and keep her car . They discover that the envelope given to Mrs. Sturak by their mother with their summer money is empty ; she had it on her when they delivered her body to the funeral home . </P> <P> With no money to pay the family 's bills , Sue Ellen finds work at a fast food restaurant called Clown Dog . Despite a budding relationship with her co-worker named Bryan , she quits because of the obnoxious manager . Sue Ellen then forges a résumé under the guise of a young fashion designer and applies at General Apparel West ( GAW ) , hoping to secure a job as a receptionist . However , Rose Lindsey ( Joanna Cassidy ) , a company executive , finds her résumé so impressive that she offers Sue Ellen a job as an administrative assistant , much to the chagrin of Carolyn , a receptionist on Rose 's floor who was initially in line for the job . While having dinner at a restaurant that night , Mrs. Sturak 's car is stolen by drag queens , forcing Sue Ellen to call in a favor from Bryan to bring them home . Sue Ellen then obtains the keys to her mother 's Volvo , and begins stealing from petty cash at GAW to support the family , intending to return it when she receives her paycheck . </P> <P> At work , Sue Ellen has to balance the adult responsibilities thrust upon her while still trying to enjoy herself as a teenager . The double life strains her relationship with Bryan when she discovers that he and Carolyn are brother and sister . Sue Ellen then finds herself tested when she learns that GAW is in danger of going out of business . She takes it upon herself to create a new clothing line and Rose suggests holding a fashion show to exhibit their new designs . Sue Ellen offers to host the party , convincing her siblings to help clean up the house , beautify the yard , and act as caterers . Although she manages to pull off the party , it comes to an end when Mrs. Crandell comes home early and catches Sue Ellen in the act , forcing her to confess her lie in front of everyone . While apologizing to Rose after the party , Sue Ellen learns that her unique designs had saved GAW . Rose then offers the real Sue Ellen the job as her personal assistant , which she respectfully declines in favor of going to college first . Rose tells Sue Ellen that she can `` pull some strings '' to get her in to Vassar and they make plans to get together for dinner . </P> <P> In the end , Sue Ellen and Bryan make up , but are soon interrupted by Mrs. Crandell , who inquires about Mrs. Sturak 's whereabouts . As the credits roll , the scene cuts away to the cemetery , where two morticians look over a gravestone that reads `` Nice Old Lady Inside , Died of Natural Causes .

The most common form of Jaffa cakes are circular , 2 ⁄ inches ( 54 mm ) in diameter and have three layers : a Genoise sponge base , a layer of orange flavoured jam and a coating of chocolate . Jaffa cakes are also available as bars or in small packs , and in larger and smaller sizes . The original Jaffa Cakes come in packs of 12 , 24 or 36 . </P> <P> Because McVitie 's did not trademark the name `` Jaffa Cakes '' , other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name . The product 's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991 , with the court finding in McVitie 's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes . In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Manufacture </Li> <Li> 2 Flavour variants </Li> <Li> 3 Categorisation as cake or biscuit for VAT </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Manufacture </H2> <P> McVitie 's entire line of Jaffa cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie 's factory in Stockport . The Jaffa cake production area covers an acre ( 4,000 m ) and includes a production line over a mile ( 1.6 km ) long which sits on the Stockport side of the site 's boundary with Manchester . Because of the nature of the product -- having multiple components of cake , chocolate covering and jam -- special hardware accelerators were devised to allow rapid computer inspection of 20 products per second , taking place under four symmetrically placed lights . </P> <H2> Flavour variants </H2> <P> Although Jaffa cakes are usually orange flavour , limited edition flavours have been available , such as lemon - and - lime , strawberry and blackcurrant . </P> <H2> Categorisation as cake or biscuit for VAT </H2> <P> In the United Kingdom , value added tax is payable on chocolate - covered biscuits , but not on chocolate - covered cakes . McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991 , against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape , and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits . McVities insisted that the product was a cake , and allegedly produced a giant Jaffa cake in court to illustrate its point . The product was assessed on the following criteria : </P> <Ul> <Li> The product 's name was regarded as a minor consideration . </Li> <Li> The ingredients were regarded as similar to those of a cake , producing a thin cake - like batter rather than the thick dough of a biscuit . </Li> <Li> The product 's texture was regarded as being that of a sponge cake . </Li> <Li> The product hardens when stale , in the manner of a cake . </Li> <Li> A substantial part of the Jaffa cake , in terms of bulk and texture , is sponge . </Li> <Li> In size , the Jaffa cake is more like a biscuit than a cake . </Li> <Li> The product was generally displayed for sale alongside other biscuits , rather than with cakes . </Li> <Li> The product is presented as a snack and eaten with the fingers , like a biscuit , rather than with a fork as a cake might be . The tribunal also considered that children would eat them in `` a few mouthfuls '' , in the manner of a sweet . </Li> </Ul> <P> The court found in favour of McVitie 's and ruled that the product should be considered a cake , meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa cakes in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> In Ireland , Jaffa cakes are regarded as cakes by Revenue as their moisture content is greater than 12 % . As a result , they are charged the reduced rate of VAT ( 13.5 % as of 2016 ) . </P> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Labelling rules '' . Food Standards Agency . 9 April 2008 .

Steinwand developed a new type of cheese at his father 's cheese factory near Colby , Wisconsin . The cheese was named after the village , which had been founded three years earlier . While Colby cheese is still widely available , it is no longer produced in Colby . A festival commemorating the cheese is held every year in mid-July where all local food booths offer free Colby cheese . On August 12 , 2015 , the original cheese factory was torn down leaving only the foundations of the building . </P> <P> An 1898 issue of the Colby Phonograph noted that `` A merchant in Phillips gives as one of the 13 reasons why people should trade with him , that he sells the genuine Steinwand Colby Cheese . '' </P> <H2> Properties ( edit ) </H2> <P> Colby is similar to Cheddar , but does not undergo the cheddaring process . Considered a semi-hard cheese , Colby is softer , moister , and milder than cheddar because it is produced through a washed - curd process . During this process , the whey is replaced with water during the cooking time , reducing the curd 's acidity , and resulting in Colby 's characteristically mild flavor . As with most other cheeses , it takes a little more than a U.S. gallon of milk to produce one pound ( just over 8 liters for a kilogram ) of cheese . Monterey Jack cheese is produced almost identically to Colby , but Colby is seasoned with annatto which gives it a sweet nutty flavor and its orange color . </P> <P> Longhorn is the best known style of the American Colby cheeses . `` Longhorn '' refers to the long orange cylindrical shape of the cheese . Colby is available in both its original shape and in rectangles and half rounds . Colby is not aged and dries out quickly . </P> <H2> Uses ( edit ) </H2> <P> Because it is such a mild cheese , Colby is seldom used in cooking . It is typically used as a table cheese , for grating and grilling , and in snacks and salads . </P> <H2> Derivatives ( edit ) </H2> <P> Colby is sometimes mixed with Monterey Jack to produce a marbled cheese often called Colby - Jack or Co-Jack . </P> <P> Pinconning cheese is a sharp aged relative of Colby cheese . </P> <P> In 2015 , artist John Riepenhoff and cheesemaker Bob Wills created a Double Cream Colby . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Dairy Good : Home '' .

Eric is based on the adolescence of show creator Mark Brazill . Most of the show takes place at the Formans ' home , particularly in the basement , where he and his five friends hang out . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Storylines <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Season eight </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Personality </Li> <Li> 3 Relationships </Li> <Li> 4 Other appearances </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <P> Being the show 's main character for the first seven seasons , Eric appears in many storylines . The show opens with Eric , a scrawny , socially awkward 16 - year - old , dealing with his ever - evident and growing crush on the girl next door , Donna Pinciotti . During this time , Eric obtains the signature 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser and takes it out of town , despite his father 's warnings not to . This , evidently , impresses Donna and leads to the pair 's first kiss . The next episode , Eric 's Birthday set on May 18 , 1976 ( originally making him born in 1959 ) , sees the pair dealing with their kiss as well as Eric 's long - awaited 17th birthday . As the series progresses , Eric 's friends ' influence over him begins to surface as he finds himself arrested due to Kelso being caught driving a stolen car while he was a passenger , due to an earlier ban on his Vista Cruiser . Eric and Donna soon share a first date , but all goes awry as Donna becomes intoxicated due to a mix - up with the drink order , causing an awkward and uncomfortable experience for Eric . During the high school prom , the two decide to rent a nearby motel room for after , though ultimately decide not to engage in intercourse after receiving the attention of fellow students . </P> <P> Coinciding with the beginning of his relationship with Donna , ( he secretly has a crush on Veronica Russell ) Eric must deal with the death of his grandmother , sharing a rare bonding moment with his father Red and his best friend Hyde 's abandonment . It is Eric who ultimately decides that Hyde should move in with them . Season 2 's episode , `` Halloween '' revealed that it was Eric who causes Hyde 's downward spiral to rebellious stoner due to Eric framing Hyde for the destruction of a classmates school work . The pair end up in an argument , but all is resolved as they choose to forget it ever happened . Eric is suspended from school for smoking on school property after taking the blame but is allowed to return to school when the truth is later revealed . He also received his first steady job from his father at PriceMart and Donna and Eric lose their virginity to each other at Midge and Bob 's renewal wedding vows . </P> <P> Throughout season three , the pair 's relationship holds a steady foundation despite Eric 's constant awkward antics , such as accidental sexism and pantsing Donna . However , things take a turn for the worse as Eric 's offer for a promise ring is rejected by Donna and he decides that if she does n't see a future with him they should break up . Despite it being his decision , this leads him to spiral into depression , dreaming at one point what it would be like if he had never dated Donna . He is angered on several occasions as Donna deals with their breakup and the downfall of her parents ' marriage by acting insultingly toward him , even publishing in the school 's newspaper a story that parallels their relationship . He is also resentful of her relationship with Michael Kelso 's older brother Casey , who is offensive and smug . When Donna begins acting out due to Casey 's influence , Eric becomes concerned but refuses to take her back the evening Casey breaks up with her . </P> <P> Regretting it instantly , Eric goes to find her to once again reconcile , and learns that she and Michael have taken off for California where they spend the remainder of the summer . Despite his parents foreboding , Eric takes off after Donna and they reconcile instantly and continue their relationship . Later , Eric contemplates in front of his friends the idea of proposing to Donna , something they all instantly point out the idiocy . However , the two do get engaged as he proposes , somewhat awkwardly , atop the water tower . After taking the SAT 's he realizes he got the lowest score of the group , even getting a worse score than Kelso , prompting him to work harder in order to marry Donna . Eric also thinks hard about his future , choosing to move to Madison with Donna . In the fifth season , Eric and Donna become engaged , despite widespread discouragement ( and anger , in the case of Red ) . However , they refuse to call off the engagement and remain engaged until the end of the sixth season . Eventually , they both begin to experience pre-wedding jitters and Eric , acting upon these feelings , skips his wedding rehearsal . He then returns in the next episode and Donna forgives him . </P> <P> After spending much of 1978 -- 79 lazing around , Eric eventually decides he needs to do something with his life . This prompts many attempts to find a long - term career . It is not until a conversation with friends that he realizes his passion is in teaching . However , Red has spent Eric 's college money on his muffler shop , but the guidance counselor at Eric 's former high school offers him the choice of a fully paid education if he first spends a year teaching in Africa . Eric accepts , much to his mother and Donna 's dismay . After a few weeks of preparation and receiving the cold treatment from Kitty and Donna , Eric packs his bags and prepares to leave . With the blessing from Red and forgiveness from his mother and Donna , he drives off with the Vista Cruiser to a hearty farewell . </P> <P> Eric 's family includes his doting mother , Kitty Forman , who has impending separation anxiety and menopause , his crabby father , Red Forman , who is a strict Korean War military veteran , and his older sister , Laurie Forman , who is a promiscuous blonde who uses her looks to get what she wants . Eric 's best friend , Steven Hyde , who was essentially abandoned by his parents , later becomes his foster brother . Eric was the show 's protagonist from seasons one through seven until he was written out due to Grace 's departure from the series . However , despite Eric 's absence , he is mentioned at least once in all 22 episodes of season eight . He makes a brief cameo appearance in the final episode titled `` That ' 70s Finale . '' </P> <H3> Season eight ( edit ) </H3> <P> Due to Eric 's departure from the show at the beginning of its eighth season , Eric was no longer the central focus of the show , though his character was still heavily used to influence elements of it , and he 's mentioned in every episode of the season . Picking up a month after the seventh season 's finale , Eric is revealed to have successfully become accustomed to his job teaching in Africa . As Donna 's relationship with a new character Randy begins to intensify , it becomes apparent that Eric has broken up with her yet again . Eric returns home on New Year 's Eve to reconcile with Donna , welcome the new year in with his friends and continue his teaching career . </P> <H2> Personality ( edit ) </H2> <P> A nice guy at heart , Eric is generally geeky , physically weak and somewhat clumsy . He is not athletic and shows little interest in sports . He is a smart - aleck teenager with a lightning - fast wit and a sarcastic and deadpan sense of humor . He also lights `` incense '' with his friends in his basement . Eric is also known to screw things up a lot , which is parodied throughout the series . </P> <P> Eric is often picked on for his slight stature and other characters have likened him to `` Opie '' ( for the character Opie Taylor , from The Andy Griffith Show ) , and Archie Andrews . Other unfortunate nicknames include `` Foreplay '' ( by Casey Kelso ) , `` Foreskin '' ( by Donna ) , `` Zitty Stardust '' ( in reference to him being unable to take a zit - free yearbook photo ) , `` Scrawny Little Neighbor Boy '' ( by Hyde ) , and `` Dumbass '' ( by Red ) . </P> <P> His girlfriend Donna is physically stronger , smarter and larger than he is , a fact which is cause for many jokes by all who know them . Donna is seen beating everyone individually on more than one occasion . </P> <P> Though physically weak , Eric can show a surprising amount of courage and even physical power when necessary . When incensed enough he will stand up to anyone , including his father and during these moments he can be surprisingly eloquent . He stood up to Red when he was troubled about Kitty 's apparent pregnancy and told him to be a man for her . He also stands up to both of his parents in his insistence on marrying Donna , despite their repeated attempts to stop him . He threatens Casey Kelso with serious injury if he hurt Donna and even defended his father by punching another teenager ( David Milbank ) who had informed him that Red will eventually lose his job at the auto parts plant . He also beat a Green Bay Packers fan up during a game , after the fan ( along with Red ) repeatedly insult Eric for wearing a Chicago Bears jersey ; however , Eric turns to violence only when the fan insults Red for telling him to stop arguing once the game was over , as Red only saw the argument as being appropriate banter between opposing fans during the game . This made Red proud enough to remark that his son had the `` Forman Rage . '' </P> <P> Eric 's best friend is rebel Steven Hyde . When Hyde 's mother leaves town at the end of the first season , Eric tries to persuade his parents to do something about his best friend 's living conditions and thus Hyde is invited to live with the Formans , which he does for most of the series . When Red is quick to throw Hyde out after an arrest for drug possession , Eric attempts to help him by proving Red 's hypocrisy . </P> <P> Of his group of friends , Eric seemed to dislike Jackie the most in the beginning , though as the series progresses , they develop a friendship . Throughout , the two have a clear `` frenemy '' relationship . They demonstrate their annoyance with each other , but show compassion for each other many times , and through it all , are close . At the series ' beginning , Jackie admits to trusting and liking Eric , confiding in him that she might be pregnant . In `` The Pill , '' for example , she says to Eric 's surprise , `` Look , I 've always been able to trust you -- and , god , you are such a nice guy . '' Later in the episode , once Kelso threatens to break up with Jackie , Eric yells at him , having developed protective feelings towards her . This proves that their burning of each other throughout the show is only for laughs and friendly bickering , as none of their hostility is ever serious . Eric is consistent in ignoring Jackie as an object of sexual desire , but this changes in `` What Is and What Should Never Be '' where Hyde helps Eric realize that Jackie is `` hot . '' After this , Eric has shown to have a sexual attraction to her , as shown in many episodes . Jackie is , at times , demeaning towards Eric due to his effeminate qualities , dorkiness and physical weakness . They have been known to occasionally help each other out . In the episode `` Jackie 's Cheese Squeeze , '' Eric admits that they are `` friends , '' as long as they do n't refer to each other as such in public , and in the season seven finale , Jackie calls Eric from Chicago and admits that she 's always cared for him , and that he was always very special to her . </P> <P> Eric is a well - known fan of science fiction , such as Star Trek and especially Star Wars , in which he compares himself to Luke Skywalker . This is cause for much ridicule at the hands of his exasperated family and friends . He is known to keep a collection of Star Wars models and figurines . He is also known to have a large , beloved collection of G.I. Joe . He listens to artists such as Led Zeppelin , KISS , Aerosmith , Pink Floyd , Lynyrd Skynyrd , Deep Purple , Queen , Styx and Rush . He is also a Beatles fan and has been known to liken his group of friends to them , accusing Jackie of `` breaking up the band '' with her romantic entanglements with Kelso and Hyde ( calling her Yoko , in reference to Yoko Ono ) . It is also hinted that he is both a Batman and Spider - Man fan , having Spider - Man bed sheets and a considerable number of comic books , most of them bearing the Marvel Comics logo with the titular character on the covers . When he fights a fan at the Packers game , he tells Red that he learned his moves from Spider - Man ; coincidentally , Topher Grace starred as Eddie Brock , a character who obtains powers very similar to Spider - Man , thus transforming him into the monstrous Venom in Spider - Man 3 in 2007 . </P> <P> Eric has had many typical teenage jobs over the series . He has worked at Fatso Burger , PriceMart , a dog food factory and as a waiter at the Holiday Hotel . In the beginning of the series , Red vehemently opposes Eric 's attempts to get a job during the second season citing that it would interfere with his schoolwork and make it harder for him to get into a good college located far away . Kitty supports Red by saying Eric 's job is being her `` precious little baby boy . '' When Eric announces his marriage proposal to Red and Kitty , Red fires him from his job at PriceMart so he could n't make the money to get married . Kitty costs him a potential job at a bank for the same reason . Red and Kitty even go so far as to revoke their offer to pay for Eric 's college tuition in a final act of desperation to put a stop to the wedding but are unsuccessful . In season seven , Eric is ridiculed by his father when he takes a year off from school and work to contemplate his future and enjoy being lazy . Eric takes pleasure in the contempt Red has for this decision . </P> <P> Eric is usually very supportive of his friends , even though it is very rarely reciprocated . On several occasions , when the group find themselves in a predicament as the result of a prank gone awry or some other unforeseen circumstance , the rest of the group would take off , leaving Eric to absorb the brunt of the trouble , after which the group ( mainly Hyde ) would hassle and tease Eric for getting into trouble ( as in `` Stolen Car , '' `` Eric Gets Suspended , '' `` Eric 's Hot Cousin '' and `` Rip This Joint '' ) . This has much to do with Eric 's trusting nature and indicates that what he lacks in physical strength and courage , he more than makes up for in strength of character . Eric however , has been known to get his revenge on his backstabbing friends from time to time , such as when Kelso took the group on a `` dine - and - dash '' without telling them and the group eventually abandoning Donna and Eric at the restaurant . Eric and Donna get their revenge by serving a batch of brownies which they referred to as `` special '' brownies . However , in this case , the `` special '' ingredient that Eric and Donna include is a chocolate - flavored laxative . This was a particular problem for Fez , whose girlfriend had arrived to make amends with him , just as he was running for the bathroom . At times , however , Eric 's friends will come to his aid when he 's truly at the end of his rope . His less morally inclined friends are quick to take advantage of him and sometimes take his willingness to help them for granted . However , Eric is also quick to stand up for himself whenever he feels he has been wronged by his friends ' actions . Although in later episodes , he seems to become more selfish , babied by his mother and lazy . </P> <P> Eric is also quite stubborn , which has on several occasions brings bad luck to himself . For example , when Donna calls from California and when Kitty tries to tell him , Eric refuses to even listen to his mother and ( when he finds out the call ) later scolds her for not telling him . Also , when Hyde is about to get kicked out of the Forman 's house for his drug use , Eric tells Red that he also does drugs ( despite Donna telling him not to ) , only to find out that Hyde is allowed to stay . Another prime example is during his first break - up with Donna : he refuses to see the signs that she is hesitant to say they will always be together , even when Hyde tries to explain it to him , and when faced with the truth chooses to end the relationship rather than accept Donna is not ready . ( However , he would later on acknowledge it was unfair for him to pressure Donna . ) </P> <H2> Relationships ( edit ) </H2> <P> Eric 's relationship with his parents is characterized by his attempts to prove to them that he is mature and independent . Eric 's father , Red , is a notorious authoritarian and often refers to Eric as `` dumbass '' and `` boy . '' He frequently threatens `` to put his foot in Eric 's ass . '' Red finds Eric lacking the qualities which he feels a grown man should possess , including physical strength , sportsmanship , and interest in manly pursuits , like hunting and fishing . Despite the fact that Red 's strict parenting often prevents intimate father - son moments , Red truly cares for his son . On rare occasions , Red displays genuine fatherly love such as in `` That Wresting Show '' and `` Street Fighting Man , '' as well as when he learns that Eric is a good hunter and chose not to shoot a deer because he did n't want to . Oddly , Eric is , in many ways , a younger version of his father . Both display a dry sense of humor and tend to be the sanest people in their circle of friends . </P> <P> Eric 's mother , Kitty , typically supports Eric against the wishes of her husband and she often scolds Red for being too hard on him . However , she also does not consider Eric to be a man and often refers to him as her `` precious little baby boy . '' Eric appreciates his mom 's support but her overblown displays of affection often leave him feeling embarrassed . At times , Kitty 's love for Eric borders on Hitchcockian . His mother is often insecure about being replaced by Donna as the woman in Eric 's life . Their rivalry is played up in many episodes ( often comically , but sometimes to the point of it being problematic ) . In theory , she 's okay with a sexual relationship between Donna and Eric ( even pressing the two to discuss it with her ) ; however , in reality , she goes into a depression after learning that Eric and Donna had sex and considers Donna a harlot who has stolen her baby boy away from her . Eric reassured Kitty that he would always need her because , `` ( Red ) 's going to be riding ( his ) ass for the rest of ( his ) life '' . When Eric tells his parents about his plan to spend a year teaching in Africa , his mother is less than thrilled . This is most notably and comically presented when , the morning after his announcement , Kitty fixes everyone at the breakfast table a smiley - face breakfast with eggs and bacon and then hands Eric a plain pancake and says , `` nothing smiling up at you , nothing '' . Even with a couple of days before his departure , Kitty reveals that she hid mailed notifications that Eric must receive certain vaccinations before he can leave . Eric protests his mom 's actions but she still tries to dissuade him , stating that the needles used for the vaccinations are `` as big as sausages '' and `` will hurt a lot . '' </P> <P> In the episode `` Eric 's Birthday , '' the gang is acutely aware that Kitty has planned a surprise party for Eric , despite her claims to the contrary . This annoys Eric because he believes that surprise parties are for kids , which indicates that Kitty wo n't accept the fact that he is becoming a man . However , throughout the episode `` Magic Bus , '' Eric expects Kitty to throw him a surprise party even though she and the gang constantly tell him that there is no surprise party . He becomes upset when he realizes that his mother is telling the truth . After Eric disobeys his parents ' orders not to go forward with his plans to marry Donna , Red finally deems Eric a man and offers his blessing while a devastated Kitty turns on Red for allowing her `` precious baby boy '' to get married . Though Eric and Donna call off the wedding , they decide to move , which causes Kitty even more grief . She 's even less pleased when she learns that Red is fine with it . </P> <P> Eric 's relationship with his older sister , Laurie , is based on mutual ridicule and contempt . Eric repeatedly mocks Laurie for being a whore while she chides him for being weak and less favored by their father . On several occasions , Eric and Laurie have tolerated each other and have even shown a brother - sister bond . When Eric saw his parents having sex , Laurie tried to comfort him , which included hugging him and stroking his hand . In the middle of a fight between the two , Hyde tried to break it up , and the two teamed up on him , complimenting each other 's insults . Eric once even defended Laurie from Red . After discovering that Laurie moved out and was living with a man , Red , having been forced to face reality about his daughter 's behavior and reputation , attempted to alienate her . Sympathizing with her , Eric attempted to defend Laurie , saying that Red was being too hard on her . Laurie once told Eric and Donna to move away after they got married and even cried during her apology . Eric tasted the tear and , having deemed it legitimate , replied `` I have a sister ! '' and hugged her . Laurie appeared to have turned a new leaf but soon regressed back to her old habits of mean - spirited and lascivious behavior . </P> <H2> Other appearances ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Topher Grace briefly reprised the role in a Robot Chicken skit , featuring the That ' 70s Show characters .

The screenplay by David Scarpa is based on the 1940 classic science fiction short story `` Farewell to the Master '' by Harry Bates and on the 1951 screenplay adaptation by Edmund H. North . </P> <P> Directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , this version replaces the Cold War theme of nuclear warfare with the contemporary issue of humankind 's environmental damage to the planet . It follows Klaatu , an alien sent to try to change human behavior or eradicate humans from Earth . </P> <P> The film was originally scheduled for release on May 9 , 2008 , but was released on a roll - out schedule beginning December 12 , 2008 , screening in both conventional and IMAX theaters . The critical reviews were mainly negative , with 186 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes showing only 21 % of them were positive ; typically the film was found to be `` heavy on special effects , but without a coherent story at its base '' . In its opening week , the film took top spot at the U.S. box office and went on to gross over $233 million worldwide . The Day the Earth Stood Still was released on home video on April 7 , 2009 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Development </Li> <Li> 3.2 Filming </Li> <Li> 3.3 Effects </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Music </Li> <Li> 5 Release </Li> <Li> 6 Reception <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Critical response </Li> <Li> 6.2 Box office </Li> <Li> 6.3 Home media </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1928 , a solitary mountaineer encounters a glowing sphere . He loses consciousness and when he wakes , the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken . </P> <P> In the present day , a rapidly moving object is detected beyond Jupiter 's orbit and forecast to impact Manhattan . It is moving at 30,000 kilometers per second , enough to destroy all life on Earth . The United States government hastily assembles a group of scientists , including Dr. Helen Benson and her friend Dr. Michael Granier , to develop a survival plan . </P> <P> As it nears the planet , the object slows down just before impact . Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship , it lands gently in Central Park . The sphere is quickly surrounded by NYPD and heavily armed US military forces . An alien emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it ; but amidst the confusion , the alien is shot . A gigantic robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity before the wounded alien voices the command `` Klaatu barada nikto '' to shut down the robot 's defensive response . </P> <P> The alien 's exterior is found to be a bioengineered space suit , composed of placenta - like material covering a human - like being . The being quickly ages into Klaatu , who looks like the mountaineer from 1928 . Klaatu informs Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations , sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet . When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated , Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson , Jacob , telling them that he must finish his mission to `` save the Earth '' . </P> <P> The presence of the sphere , and other smaller ones that begin to appear all over the world , causes widespread panic . The military launches a drone attack on the Central Park sphere , but are thwarted by the robot . The military takes a weapons - free approach , cautiously enclosing the robot , soon nicknamed `` GORT '' ( for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology ) , and transporting it to Mount Weather , an underground facility in Virginia . </P> <P> Klaatu meets with another alien , Mr. Wu , who has lived on Earth for 70 years . Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive , stubborn and unwilling to change , which matches Klaatu 's experiences . Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species , to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth . He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind . When a policeman attempts to take them into custody , Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer , telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission . </P> <P> Hoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity , Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt , a Nobel Prize winner . They discuss how Klaatu 's own race went through a drastic , collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their own planet . Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice , and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change . While the adults are talking , Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu . </P> <P> While the military is examining GORT , the robot transforms into a swarm of winged , insect - like , nano - machines that self - replicate as they consume every man - made object in their path . The swarm soon devours the entire facility , emerging above ground to continue feeding . </P> <P> The military capture Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot . As they travel , Klaatu learns more about humanity through Jacob . When Jacob contacts Helen and arranges to meet at his father 's grave , the Secretary sends her to try to change Klaatu 's mind . At the grave , Jacob is heartbroken that Klaatu can not resurrect his long dead father . As Helen and Jacob have a tear - filled reunion , Klaatu 's cumulative observations of humans convinces him to stop the swarm . </P> <P> Dr. Granier drives them to the Central Park sphere , but the swarm has reached massive proportions . Klaatu trudges through the swarm to the sphere , touching it moments before his own body is consumed . The sphere deactivates the swarm , saving humanity , but at the expense of electrical activity on Earth , per Klaatu 's warning that there will be a price to the modern human way of life . The giant sphere leaves the Earth . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay that states a Wikipedia editor 's personal feelings about a topic . Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style . ( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , an alien messenger in human form . </Li> </Ul> <P> Reeves dislikes remakes , but was impressed by the script , which he deemed a reimagining . He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder of it as an adult when he understood how relevant it was , but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu `` laying down the law ( ... ) almost as though the alien had the bigger stick . '' Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is `` inverted '' from the original , starting `` sinister and tough '' but becoming `` more human , '' whereas the original was `` more human than human '' before revealing his `` big stick '' in his ending speech . He compared the remake 's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament , but is gentle and forgiving by the time of the New Testament . He spent many weeks revising the script , trying to make Klaatu 's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced . Derrickson , the director , said that although Reeves would not use actions `` that are highly unusual or highly quirky '' , he nevertheless `` keeps you aware of the fact that this being you 're walking through this movie with is not a human being . '' At Reeves ' insistence , the classic line `` Klaatu barada nikto '' was added to the script after initially being omitted . The line was recorded many times , and it was decided to combine two recordings : one where Reeves said it normally , and a reversed version where he said the line backwards , creating an `` alien '' effect . </P> <Ul> <Li> Jennifer Connelly as Helen Benson , a famed astrobiologist at Princeton University who is recruited by the government to study Klaatu . </Li> </Ul> <P> Connelly was Derrickson 's first choice for the part . She is a fan of the original film and felt Patricia Neal 's original portrayal of Helen was `` fabulous '' , but trusted the filmmakers with their reinterpretation of the story and of Helen , who was a secretary in the original . Connelly emphasized that Helen is amazed when she meets Klaatu , as she never believed she would encounter a sentient alien like him , after speculating on extraterrestrial life for so long . Connelly was dedicated to understanding her scientific jargon , with Seth Shostak stating she did `` everything short of writing a NASA grant application '' . </P> <Ul> <Li> Kathy Bates as Regina Jackson , the United States Secretary of Defense . </Li> </Ul> <P> Bates had only two weeks to film her scenes , so she often requested Derrickson act out her lines so she would directly understand his aims for her dialogue , rather than interpret vague directions . </P> <Ul> <Li> Jaden Smith as Jacob Benson , Helen 's rebellious eight - year - old stepson . His conflict with his stepmother was worsened by the death of his father , and he initially dislikes Klaatu , believing him to be a potential stepfather . Jacob replaces the character of Bobby ( Billy Gray ) in the original , and his relationship with Helen was written as a microcosm of how Klaatu comes to see humanity -- the alien sees their cold and distant relationship as normal human behavior , and their reconciliation forces him to change his mind . </Li> </Ul> <P> Smith had met Keanu Reeves before - on the set of The Matrix sequels , which featured his mother Jada Pinkett - Smith - although he was only three years old at the time . </P> <Ul> <Li> John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt , a Nobel Prize - winning physicist who specializes in the evolutionary basis of altruism . Helen takes Klaatu to him to further change his mind . </Li> </Ul> <P> The role was the most difficult to cast , and eventually the filmmakers decided to approach Cleese , noting `` Who would you rather make the argument ( to Klaatu ) for mankind than John Cleese ? '' Stoff , a producer , had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect . The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him , and decided playing a dramatic role would be easier than to play a comedic one at his age . He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns . Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters . Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard : `` The trouble is , I had to be able to write the equation , because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years . I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all . In A Fish Called Wanda , I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means . '' </P> <Ul> <Li> Jon Hamm as Dr. Michael Granier , a NASA official who recruits Helen into his scientific team investigating Klaatu . Granier is fascinated by Klaatu , but is torn between his official obligation to detain the alien and protect his country . </Li> </Ul> <P> Hamm acknowledged science fiction was a niche genre when the original film was made , and that it used science fiction to make topical issues more approachable . Hamm had the same feelings for this remake . Originally , Hamm 's character was French and named Michel . Although he is interested in math and science , Hamm found his technical dialogue difficult and had to film his lines repeatedly . </P> <Ul> <Li> Kyle Chandler as John Driscoll , an official in the US Government , who leads the research on G.O.R.T. at an underground facility . </Li> <Li> Robert Knepper as Colonel </Li> <Li> James Hong as Mr. Wu </Li> <Li> John Rothman as Dr. Myron </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1994 , 20th Century Fox and Erwin Stoff had produced the successful Keanu Reeves film Speed . Stoff was at an office at the studio when he saw a poster for the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still , which made him ponder a remake with Reeves as Klaatu . By the time David Scarpa started writing a draft of the script in 2005 , Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a responsibility to remake the film . Scarpa felt everything about the original film was still relevant , but changed the allegory from nuclear war to environmental damage because `` the specifics of ( how ) we now have the capability to destroy ourselves have changed . '' Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay . He scrapped Klaatu 's speech at the conclusion of the story because `` audiences today are ( un ) willing to tolerate that . People do n't want to be preached to about the environment . We tried to avoid having our alien looking out over the garbage in the lake and crying a silent tear ( from the 1970s Keep America Beautiful ads ) . '' </P> <P> Director Scott Derrickson admired the original film 's director Robert Wise , whom he met as a film student . He generally dislikes remakes , but he enjoyed the script , which he decided was a retelling of the story and not a true remake . He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film , unlike The Wizard of Oz , which he would not bother remaking . Derrickson 's benchmark was Philip Kaufman 's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers . Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original , because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s . There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington , D.C. , as in the original ; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu 's sphere landing in Central Park . Derrickson also did not write in Gort 's original backstory , which was already absent from the script he read . He already thought the script was a good adaptation and did n't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film . </P> <P> Astronomer Seth Shostak served as scientific consultant on the film , reviewed the script several times for errors , gave suggestions for making the scientists appear less dry , and noted that they would refer to one another on a first - name basis . He said , `` Real scientists do n't describe an object entering the solar system as ' notable for the fact that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse , but moving at nearly three times ten to the seventh meters per second . ' More likely , they would say that there was ' a goddamned rock headed our way ! ' '' </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Filming took place from December 12 , 2007 , to March 19 , 2008 , at Vancouver Film Studios , Vancouver Forum , Deer Lake , Jericho Park , and Simon Fraser University . The film was originally scheduled for release on May 9 , 2008 , but it was delayed until December 12 , 2008 , because filming commenced later than scheduled . By the time preproduction had started , Scarpa had written 40 drafts of the script . The film was mostly shot on sets because it was winter in Vancouver . </P> <P> Derrickson was fascinated by color schemes . He chose blue - green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still . The missile silo converted by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange , which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field . Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film , and rendered the colors in post-production to make them more subtle , for realism . </P> <P> To film Barnhardt and Klaatu writing equations on a blackboard , general relativity sums were drawn by Marco Peloso from the University of Minnesota and William Hiscock of Montana State University in faint pencil marks . Keanu Reeves and John Cleese drew over these in chalk . </P> <P> As Fox had a mandate to become a carbon neutral company by 2011 , The Day the Earth Stood Still 's production had an environmentally friendly regimen . `` Whether it was because of this movie thematically or it was an accident of time , there were certain things production-wise we 've been doing and been asked to do and so on , '' said Erwin Stoff . To prevent the wasting of paper , concept art , location stills and costume tests were posted on a website created by the production for crew members to reference . Costumes were kept for future Fox productions or given to homeless shelters , rather than thrown away . Hybrid vehicles were used and crew members had orders to turn off their car engines if they sat in their vehicles for more than three minutes . </P> <H3> Effects ( edit ) </H3> The redesigned Gort and behind him , the new biological spaceship resembling an orb <P> Weta Digital created the majority of the effects , with additional work by Cinesite and Flash Film Works . The machines of Klaatu 's people have a biological basis rather than a mechanical one , as Derrickson theorized that their mastery of ecology would demonstrate their level of sophistication . Derrickson deemed a modern audience would find the original 's flying saucer amusingly obsolete and unique to the original 's milieu . The director also noted that the original The Day the Earth Stood Still had influenced many films , so his technicians needed to bring new ideas to the remake . </P> <P> The effects team approached the new spacecraft 's design as inter-dimensional portals resembling orbs . The script had specified the inside of the orbs as a `` white limbo - y thing '' , but visual - effects consultant Jeff Okun explained this was deleted for being too `` cheesy '' . Derrickson felt not showing the inside of the ship , unlike the original , would make the audience more curious . As well as computer - generated spheres -- such as Klaatu 's 300 - foot ( 91 m ) ship , or a 3,000 - foot ( 910 m ) tall orb that rises from the sea -- 700 - pound ( 320 kg ) spheres , 9 feet ( 2.7 m ) in diameter , were sculpted by Custom Plastics , which built spheres for Disney theme parks . The spheres were split in two to make transportation easier . It was difficult placing lights inside them without making them melt . The visual - effects team looked at natural objects , including water droplets and the surfaces of Jupiter and Saturn for the spheres ' texture . </P> <P> Derrickson emphasized a Trinity - like relationship between the sphere , Klaatu , and Gort . Klaatu is initially depicted as a radiant focus of sentient light . He is then depicted as a 7 - foot - tall ( 2.1 m ) gray `` walking womb '' shape which finally takes on a completely human appearance . The filmmakers conceived the transitional form because they pondered the idea of humans mistaking space suits for alien skin . Computer - generated imagery and practical effects achieved the transformation . Todd Masters ( Slither ) directed the creation of the alien form , using thermal plastic and silicone . </P> <P> The script described Gort as nanotechnology by the time the director signed on , although it did not specify Gort 's appearance . The 15th draft of the script had depicted the robot as a four - legged `` Totem '' that stands upright after firing its weapon beam . Okun explained there were many more `` horrific '' or `` amazing '' concepts , but it made sense that the robot would assume a familiar human shape . He cited the Monolith from 2001 : A Space Odyssey as an inspiration for Gort 's texture , noting `` it 's a simple shape , it has no emotion ( ... ) it just simply is '' , which makes Gort more frightening because the audience can not tell what he is thinking . The animators estimated the computer - generated robot as 28 feet ( 8.5 m ) tall , whereas in the original he was played by the 7 - foot - 7 - inch ( 2.31 m ) tall Lock Martin . Gort 's computer model was programmed to reflect light , and the filmmakers spent time on motion - capture sessions to guide the performance . An actor wore weights on his hands and feet , allowing the animators to bring a sense of weight and power to Gort . His destructive capabilities were based on locust swarms , although the idea of metal - eating insects goes back to Stephen Vincent Benét 's 1933 poem `` Metropolitan Nightmare '' . </P> <H2> Music ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> The Day the Earth Stood Still : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Soundtrack album by Tyler Bates </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> December 16 , 2008 ( 2008 - 12 - 16 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Length </Th> <Td> 52 : 43 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label </Th> <Td> Varèse Sarabande </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Day the Earth Stood Still : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and conducted by Timothy Williams . Tyler Bates was brought in to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil 's Rejects and Slither . Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann , Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film , and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake . Bates said , `` People revere an original property and feel that it 's sacred , but frankly , there 's a good story to be retold , as it applies to the climate of the world now . If that 's something beyond the scope of a person 's ability to take in , on a new level , without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they 're going to enjoy it , then they probably should n't bother themselves with it . '' The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith . When he got back to L.A. , he created a sound loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded , `` I think that 's the score ! '' , when it was played for him . Bates utilized the theremin , which Herrmann heavily used for the original film 's score . Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect , especially during Klaatu 's surgery . A short segment from Bach 's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor 's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which was not included in the film 's accompanying soundtrack release . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> Before its release , The Day the Earth Stood Still was nominated for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound at the 2008 Satellite Awards . On the film 's December 12 , 2008 release , the Deep Space Communications Network at Cape Canaveral was to transmit the film to Alpha Centauri . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> Keanu Reeves and Scott Derrickson on film promotion in Mexico . December 12 , 2008 . <P> Metacritic , a film review aggregator , gave the film a 40 / 100 approval rating based on 34 reviews by top rated reviewers , placing it in the `` mixed reviews '' category . Based on 186 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , only 21 % of them were positive . The majority found the film `` heavy on special effects , but without a coherent story at its base , ( the film ) is a subpar re-imagining of the 1951 science - fiction classic . '' Bruce Paterson of the Australian Film Critics Association gave the film 3 out of 5 stars , writing that the generally poor reception for the film was `` a sad fate for a surprisingly sincere tribute to Robert Wise 's 1951 classic . '' Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times ' congratulated ' Keanu Reeves 's performance and wrote in his review that `` This contemporary remake of the science - fiction classic knew what it was doing when it cast Keanu Reeves , the movies ' greatest stone face since Buster Keaton . '' </P> <P> A.O. Scott of The New York Times was not impressed with Reeves ' performance , commenting that `` even Klaatu looks bored and distracted , much as he did back when we knew him as Neo . '' William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote , `` It 's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time , following the same basic plot , full of respectful references to its model , updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects . '' Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had `` taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it '' , but also stated that it was `` an expensive , good - looking film that is well - made by Scott Derrickson '' . Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two stars and wrote in her review she felt the film was `` musty and derivative '' and thought its only bright spot was 10 - year - old Jaden Smith 's `` engaging , lively performance '' . </P> <P> At the 2009 Razzie Awards , the film was nominated for Worst Prequel , Remake , Rip - off or Sequel , but lost the award to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull . The film was nominated in the category of `` Best Single Visual Effect of the Year '' at the 7th Visual Effects Society Awards but lost to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button . </P> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Day the Earth Stood Still opened in North America on December 12 , 2008 . During that opening weekend , and despite poor response from critics , the film reached the # 1 spot , grossing $30,480,153 from 3,560 theaters with an $8,562 average per theater . Out of the film 's opening weekend income , 12 % was from IMAX ; it was `` the highest IMAX share yet for a two - dimensional title '' . In 2008 , it was the 27th highest - grossing film during its opening weekend but 40th for the entire year . The Day the Earth Stood Still was able to stay in the top 10 for its first four weeks in theaters . The film ended up grossing $79,366,978 domestically and $153,726,881 in foreign markets , a total of $233,093,859 . </P> <H3> Home Media ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Day the Earth Stood Still was released on DVD and Blu - ray on April 7 , 2009 , almost four months after its release and only five days after its theater run ended . Bonus features include commentary with Scarpa along with a picture - in - picture showing the special effects footage , concept art , and photos . It also includes several featurettes : `` Build Your Own Gort '' , `` Re-Imagining The Day '' , `` Unleashing Gort '' , `` Watching the Skies : In Search of Extraterrestrial Life '' , and `` The Day the Earth was Green . '' Also included were three still galleries and the film 's trailer . Packaged with the film on a separate disc , is the original 1951 film . The Blu - ray release features a D - BOX motion code . </P> <P> According to data by Home Media Magazine , it came in first for rentals during its first and second weeks . For the first week of its release it was ranked first in Blu - ray sales , and second on the regular DVD sales chart , behind Bedtime Stories , totaling $14,650,377 ( not including Blu - ray ) . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` The Day the Earth Stood Still ( 12A ) '' .

Written by Bronte Woodard and directed by Randal Kleiser in his theatrical feature film debut , the film depicts the lives of two high school seniors : a bad boy ( played by John Travolta ) and a good girl ( played by Olivia Newton - John ) in the late 1950s . Grease was successful both critically and commercially . Its soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second - best selling album of the year in the United States , behind the soundtrack of the 1977 blockbuster Saturday Night Fever , and earned the film its lone Oscar nomination for `` Hopelessly Devoted to You '' ( which lost the Academy Award for Best Original Song to Donna Summer 's `` Last Dance '' from Thank God It 's Friday at the 51st Academy Awards ) . </P> <P> A sequel , Grease 2 , was released in 1982 , with Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in lead roles . Few of the original cast members reprised their roles . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Principal cast </Li> <Li> 2.2 School staff / others </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Casting </Li> <Li> 3.2 Filming locations </Li> <Li> 3.3 Post-production </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Release and reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Box office </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4.3 Home video </Li> <Li> 4.4 Awards </Li> <Li> 4.5 American Film Institute Recognition </Li> <Li> 4.6 Sequels and spin - offs </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 Television </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the summer of 1958 , Danny Zuko and vacationing Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love . When the summer comes to an end , Sandy , who is going back to Australia , frets that they might never meet again , but Danny tells her that their love is `` only the beginning '' , and they will stay friends . The film moves to the start of the new school year at Rydell High School ( `` Grease '' ) . Danny , a greaser , is a member of the T - Birds , consisting of his best friend Kenickie , Doody , Sonny , and Putzie . The Pink Ladies , a sassy , popular clique of girls , also arrive , consisting of Rizzo , Frenchy , Marty , and Jan . </P> <P> After her parents unexpectedly decide to move from Australia , Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy , who considers dropping out of high school to become a beautician by going to a beauty school . Unaware of each other 's presence at Rydell , Danny and Sandy tell their curious groups the accounts of events during the pair 's brief romance , without initially mentioning the other 's name . Sandy 's version emphasizes the romance of the affair , and the truth and purity , while Danny 's version is more sexual ( `` Summer Nights '' ) . </P> <P> When Sandy finally tells everyone it was Danny Zuko , Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two at a pep rally , where Sandy is cheering along with high - achiever and resident swot , Patty Simcox . At the rally , Sandy catches the eye of a muscly member of the football team . When Sandy and Danny are reunited , they are initially elated , but Danny soon slips back into his greaser attitude , which offends Sandy . At the same rally , Kenickie reveals his new car , a dilapidated used jalopy , and announces he has entered it into a `` pinks '' street race at Thunder Road . </P> <P> Frenchy invites Sandy to her house for a sleepover . Sandy vomits at trying her first cigarette , drinking a dessert wine , and getting her ears pierced by Frenchy . While she recovers in the bathroom , Rizzo makes fun of her innocent and virtuous nature ( `` Look At Me , I 'm Sandra Dee '' ) . The T - Birds arrive in Kenickie 's car , and Rizzo departs with Kenickie , leaving the other T - Birds stranded . Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny , despite his earlier behavior ( `` Hopelessly Devoted to You '' ) . Before Kenickie and Rizzo start having sex , the condom Kenickie is using breaks . The two are also interrupted by Leo , leader of the T - Birds ' rival gang , the Scorpions , and his tall and brash girlfriend Cha - Cha . </P> <P> The next day , the T - Birds are looking over Kenickie 's car , and although they are initially skeptical of its potential , Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot - rodding sex machine ( `` Greased Lightnin ' '' ) . In an attempt to impress Sandy , Danny approaches Coach Calhoun in an effort to become a high school athlete . Danny 's pride and lack of experience lead to him picking fights with the jocks when he tries to play basketball , wrestling or baseball , so Calhoun suggests cross-country running , in which Danny excels . Danny 's running proves to impress Sandy , prompting the two to reconcile for a date at the Frosty Palace ; when the other greasers arrive , Danny and Sandy promptly leave in discomfort . Kenickie and a noticeably distressed Rizzo get into an argument and break up , while Putzie and Jan arrange to go to the dance . Left alone , Frenchy -- who dropped out of Rydell to enroll in beauty school , only to quit when she turned her own hair bright pink -- is visited by a guardian angel who advises her to return to Rydell ( `` Beauty School Dropout '' ) . </P> <P> The school dance arrives , broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine , who flirts with Marty . Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha - Cha as their dates , while Danny and Sandy arrive together . Danny and Sandy dance well and appear to be on their way to winning the competition , but a drunken Sonny pulls Sandy off the floor partway through . Cha - Cha joins Danny for the rest of the dance , and the two win ( `` Born to Hand Jive '' ) . During the last dance ( `` Blue Moon '' ) , Putzie leads Sonny and Doody in a mooning of the national TV audience , which Principal McGee vows to put on their permanent records . </P> <P> Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive - in theater . She 's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he gives Sandy his ring , which she gleefully accepts . Moments later , Danny tries to aggressively make out with her , causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and depart , leaving Danny distraught ( `` Sandy '' ) . Meanwhile , because she skipped a period , Rizzo quietly admits she may be pregnant to Marty , who in turn tells Sonny , and the rumor spreads like wildfire through the drive - in , reaching Kenickie just as Rizzo is walking past . He attempts to talk to Rizzo about it , telling her he does n't run away from his mistakes . Rizzo tells him it was someone else 's mistake , a response that angers Kenickie . At school the next day , word of Rizzo 's pregnancy fears reaches Patty Simcox , who has spread the gossip to her clique and sneers at Rizzo as they walk by . A visibly hurt Rizzo , who thanks Sandy for her offer of help , sings to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be ( `` There Are Worse Things I Could Do '' ) . </P> <P> On the day of the race , Kenickie asks Danny to be on standby in case he decides to back out . Moments before the race is set to begin , Kenickie suffers a concussion when he bends over to pick up a penny for good luck and Putzie opens the car door on Kenickie 's head , and Danny takes the helm of the car . Leo and Danny run a tight race , with Leo attempting to shred Danny 's tires with bladed hubcaps ( in a sequence paying homage to Ben - Hur ) ; Danny eventually wins when Leo skids out . Sandy watches from afar and concludes that she still loves Danny . She decides to change her attitude and image to impress him and asks Frenchy for help ( `` Look At Me , I 'm Sandra Dee ( Reprise ) '' ) . </P> <P> On the last day of school , a sobbing Principal McGee and her equally nostalgic assistant Blanche , in a speech over the intercom , tell the students that they could be future leaders . The school hosts a carnival where Sonny and Putzie learn that , because they either never took or failed physical education , they have to take summer school with Coach Calhoun in order to get their diplomas . </P> <P> Kenickie approaches Rizzo and demands to talk to her , only to have her reveal she is not pregnant after all . Overjoyed , they reunite . Danny shows up wearing a Letterman 's sweater and reveals he is now a letterman for the cross-country team , to the T - Birds ' dismay . Danny confesses it is a decision he has made in an effort to clean up his image so that he can be together with Sandy , telling the T - Birds that they too will have to grow up and stop following people all the time . The group is subsequently stunned when Sandy appears seconds later sporting a new hairstyle , dressed in black leather , and smoking a cigarette . In song , the two admit they love each other and reunite ( `` You 're the One That I Want '' ) and Sandy also tells Danny that if she was willing to change for him then it is only fair that he do the same for her by being faithful and more mature . </P> <P> The gang realizes that high school is now over , and worries that they 'll never see each other again . Danny insists , `` Nah , that 'll never happen , '' and everyone celebrates their friendship ( `` We Go Together '' ) . As the song nears its conclusion , Danny and Sandy depart in a red hot rod , which takes flight , and the pair wave goodbye to their friends . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Principal cast ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> John Travolta as Danny Zuko , who lives a double life as leader of the greaser gang the T - Birds and as Sandy 's boyfriend </Li> <Li> Olivia Newton - John as Sandy Olsson , Danny 's girlfriend and an Australian expatriate and ingénue , who transforms from square to greaser </Li> <Li> Stockard Channing as Betty Rizzo , Danny 's former fling and the cynical leader of the Pink Ladies clique </Li> <Li> Jeff Conaway as Kenickie , Danny 's best friend , Rizzo 's love interest and the owner of Greased Lightnin ' </Li> <Li> Barry Pearl as Doody , a member of the T - Birds ; he pairs with Frenchy at the school dance </Li> <Li> Michael Tucci as Sonny LaTierri , a trouble - making wannabe womanizer and T - Bird who courts Marty with little success over the course of the film </Li> <Li> Kelly Ward as Putzie , a member of the T - Birds whose relationship with Jan builds over the course of the film </Li> <Li> Didi Conn as Frenchy , Sandy 's closest friend in the Pink Ladies and an aspiring beautician </Li> <Li> Jamie Donnelly as Jan , a quirky member of the Pink Ladies with a liking for Ipana toothpaste </Li> <Li> Dinah Manoff as Marty Maraschino , a member of the Pink Ladies whose attractiveness regularly draws the attention of men , including Sonny and Vince Fontaine </Li> </Ul> <H3> School staff / others ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Eve Arden as Principal McGee , who shows discomfort at the goings - on at Rydell High . </Li> <Li> Dody Goodman as Secretary Blanche Hodel , who enjoys even the wilder antics at the school . </Li> <Li> Sid Caesar as Coach Vince Calhoun , the tough - talking gym teacher and coach of all the school 's perennially losing sports teams </Li> <Li> Eddie Deezen as Eugene Felsnick , the class nerd </Li> <Li> Susan Buckner as Patty Simcox , the head cheerleader and a rival for Danny 's affections </Li> <Li> Lorenzo Lamas as Tom Chisum , a popular jock who competes for Sandy 's affections </Li> <Li> Dennis C.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted , including suggesting Randal Kleiser ( who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm The Boy in the Plastic Bubble ) as director , and Olivia Newton - John , then known almost exclusively as a country music singer , as Sandy . Newton - John had done little acting before this film , with only one film credit ( the unreleased 1970 film Toomorrow , which predated her singing breakthrough ) to her name up to that time . Before accepting the role , Newton - John requested a screen test for Grease to avoid another career setback . The screen test was done with the drive - in movie scene . Newton - John , who is native to England and lived most of her life in Australia , was unable to perform with a convincing American accent , and thus her character was rewritten to be Australian . Before Newton - John was hired , Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Ann - Margret , Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role ; Newton - John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing . In a case of life imitating art , Newton - John 's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character ; her next album after Grease , the provocatively titled Totally Hot , featured a much more sexual and pop - oriented approach , with Newton - John appearing on the album cover in similar all - leather attire and teased hair . </P> <P> Jeff Conaway , like Travolta , had previously appeared in the stage version of Grease ; he had played Danny Zuko during the show 's run on Broadway . Jamie Donnelly reprised her role as Jan from the Broadway show , the only cast member to do so ; as her hair had begun to gray by this point , she had to dye her hair to resemble her stage character . Kelly Ward had previously appeared as a similar sarcastic supporting character in The Boy in the Plastic Bubble with Travolta under Kleiser ; the role was substantially rewritten from the musical . Whereas `` Rump '' in the musical sang lead on two songs and was particularly known for his mooning , the renamed `` Putzie '' did not sing and shares the mooning scene with two of the other T - Birds , Sonny and Doody . </P> <P> Lorenzo Lamas was a last - minute replacement for Steven Ford , who developed stage fright shortly before filming and backed out . His role contained no spoken dialogue and required Lamas to dye his hair blond to avoid looking like most of the other T - Birds ( although Conaway and Ward were also blonds ) . </P> <P> Henry Winkler was once considered for a lead in the film . Winkler , who was playing Arthur Fonzarelli on Happy Days , was originally chosen to play Danny . His lack of singing experience and fear of being typecast after Happy Days and the film The Lords of Flatbush led him to decline the role . Adult film star Harry Reems was originally signed to play Coach Calhoun ; however , executives at Paramount nixed the idea due to Reems ' previous work in adult films , and producers cast Sid Caesar instead . Caesar was one of several veterans of 1950s television ( Eve Arden , Frankie Avalon , Joan Blondell , Edd Byrnes , Alice Ghostley , Dody Goodman ) to be cast in supporting roles . Coincidentally , Frankie Avalon and Randal Kleiser had both appeared in 1966 's Fireball 500 , the latter as an extra . </P> <H3> Filming locations ( edit ) </H3> The car race in the film took place at the Los Angeles River . <P> The opening beach scene was shot at Malibu 's Leo Carrillo State Beach , making explicit reference to From Here to Eternity . The exterior Rydell scenes , including the basketball , baseball and track segments , were shot at Venice High School in Venice , California , while the Rydell interiors , including the high school dance , were filmed at Huntington Park High School . The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood . The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers `` Greased Lightning '' and `` Beauty School Dropout '' . The drive - in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive - In ( it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place ) . The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River , between the First and Seventh Street Bridges , where many other films have been shot . The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School . And due to budget cuts a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles . </P> <H3> Post-production ( edit ) </H3> <P> Scenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca - Cola signs . Prior to the film 's release , producer Allan Carr had made a product - placement deal with Coca - Cola 's main competitor Pepsi ( for example , a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence ) . When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca - Cola products and signage , he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca - Cola logos from the scene . As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time - consuming , optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca - Cola references . The ' blurring ' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster , but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged . According to Kleiser , `` We just had to hope that Pepsi would n't complain . They did n't . '' </P> <H2> Release and reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Grease was originally released to North American theaters on June 16 , 1978 and was an immediate box office success . In its opening weekend , the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada , ranking at No. 2 ( behind Jaws 2 ) at the box office for the weekend and with the all - time opening weekend records . Despite losing the weekend , it set a record gross in its first 19 days with $40,272,000 . </P> <P> Grease has grossed $188,755,690 domestically and $206,200,000 internationally , totaling $394,955,690 worldwide . Globally , it was the highest - grossing musical ever , eclipsing the 13 - year - old record held by The Sound of Music , but has since been overtaken by Les Misérables , Mamma Mia ! and the 2017 release of Beauty and the Beast . Grease is now the fourth highest - grossing live action musical . </P> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> Grease received mostly positive reviews from movie critics and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978 . </P> <P> Vincent Canby on its initial release in June 1978 called the film `` terrific fun '' , describing it as a `` contemporary fantasy about a 1950s teen - age musical -- a larger , funnier , wittier and more imaginative - than - Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own '' ; Canby pointed out that the film was `` somewhat in the manner of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , which recalls the science - fiction films of the ' 50s in a manner more elegant and more benign than anything that was ever made then , Grease is a multimillion - dollar evocation of the B - picture quickies that Sam Katzman used to turn out in the ' 50s ( Do n't Knock the Rock , 1956 ) and that American International carried to the sea in the 1960s ( Beach Party , 1963 ) . '' </P> <P> Grease was voted the best musical ever on Channel 4 's 100 greatest musicals in 2004 . The film holds a 75 % approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , based on 64 reviews with an average rating of 6.7 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Grease is a pleasing , energetic musical with infectiously catchy songs and an ode to young love that never gets old . '' It holds a score of 70 / 100 on the review aggregator Metacritic based on 15 reviews , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . </P> <P> Grease premiered for the first time on American television in 1981 on ABC - TV . It was re-released to theaters in 1998 to mark the 20th anniversary . The film was also ranked number 21 on Entertainment Weekly 's list of the 50 Best High School Movies . </P> <H3> Home Video ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

While only a few cast members from the original movie such as Dody Goodman , Sid Caesar , Eddie Deezen , Didi Conn , Dennis Stewart and Eve Arden reprise their respective roles . Dick Patterson returned , playing a different character . It was not as successful , grossing just $15 million on its $13 million budget . Patricia Birch , the original movie 's choreographer , directed the ill - fated sequel . It would be the only movie that she would direct . </P> <P> On July 8 , 2010 , a sing - along version of Grease was released to select theaters around the U.S. A trailer was released in May 2010 , with cigarettes digitally removed from certain scenes , implying heavy editing ; however , Paramount confirmed these changes were done only for the film 's advertising , and the rating for the film itself changed from its original PG to that of PG - 13 for `` sexual content including references , teen smoking and drinking , and language . '' The movie was shown for two weekends only ; additional cities lobbied by fans from the Paramount official website started a week later and screened for one weekend . </P> <P> On March 12 , 2013 , Grease and Grease 2 were packaged together in a Double Feature DVD set from Warner Home Video . </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Grease : The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture <P> The soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second - best selling album of the year in the United States , exceeded only by another soundtrack album , from the film Saturday Night Fever , which also starred Travolta . The song `` Hopelessly Devoted to You '' was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music -- Original Song . The song `` You 're the One That I Want '' was released as a single prior to the film 's release and became an immediate chart - topper , despite not being in the stage show or having been seen in the film at that time . Additionally , the dance number to `` You 're the One That I Want '' was nominated for TV Land 's award for `` Movie Dance Sequence You Reenacted in Your Living Room '' in 2008 . In the United Kingdom , the two Travolta / Newton - John duets , `` You 're the One That I Want '' and `` Summer Nights '' , were both number one hits and as of 2011 are still among the 20 best - selling singles of all time ( at Nos. 6 and 19 respectively ) . The movie 's title song was also a number - one hit single for Frankie Valli . </P> <P> The song `` Look at Me , I 'm Sandra Dee '' references Sal Mineo in the original stage version . Mineo was stabbed to death a year before filming , so the line was changed to refer to Elvis Presley instead . The references to Troy Donohue , Doris Day , Rock Hudson and Annette Funicello are from the original stage version . Coincidentally , this scene as well as the scene before and the scene after it were filmed on August 16 , 1977 , the date of Elvis Presley 's death . </P> <P> Some of the songs were not present in the film ; songs that appear in the film but not in the soundtrack are `` La Bamba '' by Ritchie Valens , `` Whole Lotta Shaking Going On '' by Jerry Lee Lewis , `` Alma Mater '' , `` Alma Mater Parody '' , and `` Rydell Fight Song '' . `` Alone at a Drive - in Movie ( instrumental ) '' , `` Mooning '' , and `` Freddy My Love '' are not present in the film , although all three are listed in the end credits in - addition to being on the soundtrack .

Vremennoye pravitel'stvo Rossii ) was a provisional government of Russia established immediately following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of the Russian Empire on 2 March ( 15 March , New Style ) 1917 . The intention of the provisional government was the organization of elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and its convention . The provisional government lasted approximately eight months , and ceased to exist when the Bolsheviks gained power after the October Revolution in October ( November , N.S. ) 1917 . According to Harold Whitmore Williams the history of eight months during which Russia was ruled by the Provisional Government was the history of the steady and systematic disorganisation of the army . </P> <P> For most of the life of the Provisional Government , the status of the monarchy was unresolved . This was finally clarified on 1 September ( 14 September , N.S. ) , when the Russian Republic was proclaimed , in a decree signed by Kerensky as Minister - President and Zarudny as Minister of Justice . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Overview <Ul> <Li> 1.1 World recognition </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Formation </Li> <Li> 3 Initial composition </Li> <Li> 4 April Crisis </Li> <Li> 5 July crisis and second coalition government </Li> <Li> 6 Third coalition </Li> <Li> 7 Legislative policies and problems </Li> <Li> 8 Democratization </Li> <Li> 9 Kornilov affair and declaration of Republic </Li> <Li> 10 October Revolution </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 13 Further reading <Ul> <Li> 13.1 Primary sources </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Provisional Government was formed in Petrograd by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma and was led first by Prince Georgy Lvov and then by Alexander Kerensky . It replaced the institution of the Council of Ministers of Russia , members of which after the February Revolution presided in the Chief Office of Admiralty . At the same time the Russian Emperor Nicholas II abdicated in favor of the Grand Duke Michael who agreed that he would accept after the decision of Russian Constituent Assembly . The Provisional Government was unable to make decisive policy decisions due to political factionalism and a breakdown of state structures . This weakness left the government open to strong challenges from both the right and the left . The Provisional Government 's chief adversary on the left was the Petrograd Soviet , which tentatively cooperated with the government at first , but then gradually gained control of the army , factories , and railways . The period of competition for authority ended in late October 1917 , when Bolsheviks routed the ministers of the Provisional Government in the events known as the October Revolution , and placed power in the hands of the soviets , or `` workers ' councils , '' which had given their support to the Bolsheviks . The weakness of the Provisional Government is perhaps best reflected in the derisive nickname given to Kerensky : `` persuader - in - chief .

Stürmer was succeeded by Alexander Trepov and Nikolai Golitsyn , both Prime Ministers for only a few weeks . During the February Revolution two rival institutions , the Imperial Duma and the Petrograd Soviet , both located in the Tauride Palace , competed for power . Tsar Nicholas II abdicated on 2 March ( 15 March , N.S. ) and Milyukov announced the committee 's decision to offer the Regency to his brother , Grand Duke Michael as the next tsar . Grand Duke Michael did not want to take the poisoned chalice and deferred acceptance of imperial power the next day . The Provisional Government was designed to set up elections to the Assembly while maintaining essential government services , but its power was effectively limited by the Petrograd Soviet 's growing authority . </P> <P> Public announcement of the formation of the Provisional Government was made . It was published in Izvestia the day after its formation . The announcement stated the declaration of government </P> <Ul> <Li> Full and immediate amnesty on all issues political and religious , including : terrorist acts , military uprisings , and agrarian crimes etc . </Li> <Li> Freedom of word , press , unions , assemblies , and strikes with spread of political freedoms to military servicemen within the restrictions allowed by military - technical conditions . </Li> <Li> Abolition of all hereditary , religious , and national class restrictions . </Li> <Li> Immediate preparations for the convocation on basis of universal , equal , secret , and direct vote for the Constituent Assembly which will determine the form of government and the constitution . </Li> <Li> Replacement of the police with a public militsiya and its elected chairmanship subordinated to the local authorities . </Li> <Li> Elections to the authorities of local self - government on basis of universal , direct , equal , and secret vote . </Li> <Li> Non-disarmament and non-withdrawal out of Petrograd the military units participating in the revolution movement . </Li> <Li> Under preservation of strict discipline in ranks and performing a military service - elimination of all restrictions for soldiers in the use of public rights granted to all other citizens . </Li> </Ul> <P> It also said , `` The provisional government feels obliged to add that it is not intended to take advantage of military circumstances for any delay in implementing the above reforms and measures .

On 20 -- 21 April 1917 massive demonstrations of workers and soldiers erupted against the continuation of war . Demonstrations demanded resignation of Milyukov . They were soon met by the counter-demonstrations organised in his support . General Lavr Kornilov , commander of the Petrograd military district , wished to suppress the disorders , but premier Georgy Lvov refused to resort to violence . </P> <P> The Provisional Government accepted the resignation of Foreign Minister Milyukov and War Minister Guchkov , and made a proposal to the Petrograd Soviet to form a coalition government . As a result of negotiations , on 22 April 1917 agreement was reached and 6 socialist ministers joined the cabinet . </P> <P> During this period the Provisional Government merely reflected the will of the Soviet , where left tendencies ( Bolshevism ) were gaining ground . The Government , however , influenced by the `` bourgeois '' ministers , tried to base itself on the right wing of the Soviet . Socialist ministers , coming under fire from their left wing Soviet associates , were compelled to pursue a double - faced policy . The Provisional Government was unable to make decisive policy decisions due to political factionalism and a breakdown of state structures . </P> <H2> July crisis and second coalition Government ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Kerensky First Government </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> 10th cabinet of Russia </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Date formed </Th> <Td> July 1917 ( see July Days ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Date dissolved </Th> <Td> 1 September 1917 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> People and organisations </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Head of state </Th> <Td> Grand Duke Michael ( conditionally ) Alexander Kerensky ( de facto ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Head of government </Th> <Td> Alexander Kerensky </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Member party </Th> <Td> Socialist - Revolutionaries </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Status in legislature </Th> <Td> Coalition </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Opposition cabinet </Th> <Td> Executive Committee of Petrograd Soviet </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Opposition party </Th> <Td> RSDLP </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Opposition leader </Th> <Td> Nikolay Chkheidze / Leon Trotsky </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> History </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Incoming formation </Th> <Td> Lvov </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Outgoing formation </Th> <Td> Kerensky II </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Predecessor </Th> <Td> Georgy Lvov </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Successor </Th> <Td> Alexander Kerensky </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The July Days took place in Petrograd between 3 -- 7 July ( 16 -- 20 July , N.S. ) 1917 , when soldiers and industrial workers in the city took to the streets in opposition to the Provisional Government .

The tsarist leadership represented an authoritarian , conservative form of governance . The Kadet Party ( see Constitutional Democratic Party ) , composed mostly of liberal intellectuals , formed the greatest opposition to the tsarist regime leading up to the February Revolution . The Kadets transformed from an opposition force into a role of established leadership , as the former opposition party held most of the power in the new Provisional Government , which replaced the tsarist regime . The February Revolution was also accompanied by further politicization of the masses . Politicization of working people led to the leftward shift of the political spectrum . </P> <P> Many urban workers originally supported the socialist Menshevik Party ( see Menshevik ) , while some , though a small minority in February , favored the more radical Bolshevik Party ( see Bolshevik ) . The Mensheviks often supported the actions of the Provisional Government and believed that the existence of such a government was a necessary step to achieve Communism . On the other hand , the Bolsheviks violently opposed the Provisional Government and desired a more rapid transition to Communism . In the countryside , political ideology also shifted leftward , with many peasants supporting the Socialist Revolutionary Party ( see Socialist - Revolutionary Party ) . The SRs advocated a form of agrarian socialism and land policy that the peasantry overwhelmingly supported . For the most part , urban workers supported the Mensheviks and Bolsheviks ( with greater numbers supporting the Bolsheviks as 1917 progressed ) , while the peasants supported the Socialist Revolutionaries . The rapid development and popularity of these leftist parties turned moderate - liberal parties , such as the Kadets , into `` new conservatives . '' The Provisional Government was mostly composed of `` new conservatives , '' and the new government faced tremendous opposition from the left . </P> <P> Opposition was most obvious with the development and dominance of the Petrograd Soviet , which represented the socialist views of leftist parties . A dual power structure quickly arose consisting of the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet . While the Provisional Government retained the formal authority to rule over Russia , the Petrograd Soviet maintained actual power . With its control over the army and the railroads , the Petrograd Soviet had the means to enforce policies . The Provisional Government lacked the ability to administer its policies . In fact , local soviets , political organizations mostly of socialists , often maintained discretion when deciding whether or not to implement the Provisional Government 's laws . </P> <P> Despite its short reign of power and implementation shortcomings , the Provisional Government passed very progressive legislation . The policies enacted by this moderate government ( by 1917 Russian standards ) represented arguably the most liberal legislation in Europe at the time . The independence of Church from state , the emphasis on rural self governance , and the affirmation of fundamental civil rights ( such as freedom of speech , press , and assembly ) that the tsarist government had periodically restricted shows the progressivism of the Provisional Government . Other policies included the abolition of capital punishment and economic redistribution in the countryside . The Provisional Government also granted more freedoms to previously suppressed regions of the Russian Empire . Poland was granted independence and Lithuania and Ukraine became more autonomous . </P> <P> The main obstacle and problem of the Provisional Government was its inability to enforce and administer legislative policies . Foreign policy was the one area in which the Provisional Government was able to exercise its discretion to a great extent . However , the continuation of aggressive foreign policy ( for example , the Kerensky Offensive ) increased opposition to the government . Domestically , the Provisional Government 's weaknesses were blatant . The dual power structure was in fact dominated by one side , the Petrograd Soviet . Minister of War Alexander Guchkov stated that `` We ( the Provisional Government ) do not have authority , but only the appearance of authority ; the real power lies with the Soviet '' . Severe limitations existed on the Provisional Government 's ability to rule . </P> <P> While it was true that the Provisional Government lacked enforcement ability , prominent members within the Government encouraged bottom - up rule . Politicians such as Prime Minister Georgy Lvov favored devolution of power to decentralized organizations . The Provisional Government did not desire the complete decentralization of power , but certain members definitely advocated more political participation by the masses in the form of grassroots mobilization . </P> <H2> Democratization ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rise of local organizations , such as trade unions and rural institutions , and the devolution of power within Russian government gave rise to democratization . It is difficult to say that the Provisional Government desired the rise of these powerful , local institutions . As stated in the previous section , some politicians within the Provisional Government advocated the rise of these institutions . Local government bodies had discretionary authority when deciding which Provisional Government laws to implement . For example , institutions that held power in rural areas were quick to implement national laws regarding the peasantry 's use of idle land . Real enforcement power was in the hands of these local institutions and the soviets . Russian historian W.E. Mosse points out , this time period represented `` the only time in modern Russian history when the Russian people were able to play a significant part in the shaping of their destinies '' . While this quote romanticizes Russian society under the Provisional Government , the quote nonetheless shows that important democratic institutions were prominent in 1917 Russia . </P> <P> Special interest groups also developed throughout 1917 . Special interest groups play a large role in every society deemed `` democratic '' today , and such was the case of Russia in 1917 . Many on the far left would argue that the presence of special interest groups represent a form of bourgeois democracy , in which the interests of an elite few are represented to a greater extent than the working masses . The rise of special interest organizations gave people the means to mobilize and play a role in the democratic process . While groups such as trade unions formed to represent the needs of the working classes , professional organizations were also prominent . Professional organizations quickly developed a political side to represent member 's interests . The political involvement of these groups represents a form of democratic participation as the government listened to such groups when formulating policy . Such interest groups played a negligible role in politics before February 1917 and after October 1917 . </P> <P> While professional special interest groups were on the rise , so too were worker organizations , especially in the cities . Beyond the formation of trade unions , factory committees of workers rapidly developed on the plant level of industrial centers . The factory committees represented the most radical viewpoints of the time period . The Bolsheviks gained their popularity within these institutions . Nonetheless , these committees represented the most democratic element of 1917 Russia . However , this form of democracy differed from and went beyond the political democracy advocated by the liberal intellectual elites and moderate socialists of the Provisional Government . Workers established economic democracy , as employees gained managerial power and direct control over their workplace . Worker self - management became a common practice throughout industrial enterprises . As workers became more militant and gained more economic power , they supported the radical Bolshevik party and lifted the Bolsheviks into power in October , 1917 . However , the Bolsheviks envisioned party - led control of the economy . Therefore , worker self - management , the ultimate form of economic democracy , disappeared when the Bolsheviks gained control of Russia . </P> <H2> Kornilov affair and declaration of Republic ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Kornilov affair <P> The Kornilov affair was an attempted military coup d'état by the then commander - in - chief of the Russian army , General Lavr Kornilov in September 1917 ( August old style ) . Due to the extreme weakness of the government at this point , there was talk among the elites of bolstering its power by including Kornilov as a military dictator on the side of Kerensky . The extent to which this deal had indeed been accepted by all parties is still unclear . What is clear , however , is that when Kornilov 's troops approached Petrograd , Kerensky branded them as counter-revolutionaries and demanded their arrest . This move can be seen as an attempt to bolster his own power by making him a defender of the revolution against a Napoleon - type figure . However , it had terrible consequences , as Kerensky 's move was seen in the army as a betrayal of Kornilov , making them finally disloyal to the Provisional Government . Furthermore , as Kornilov 's troops were arrested by the now armed Red Guard , it was the Soviet that was seen to have saved the country from military dictatorship . In order to defend himself and Petrograd , he provided the Bolsheviks with arms as he had little support from the army . When Kornilov did not attack Kerensky , the Bolsheviks did not return their weapons , making them a greater concern to Kerensky and the Provisional Government . </P> <P> Thus far , the status of the monarchy had been unresolved . This was clarified on 1 September ( 14 September , N.S. ) , when the Russian Republic ( Российская республика , Rossiyskaya respublika ) was proclaimed , in a decree signed by Kerensky as Minister - President and Zarudny as Minister of Justice . </P> <P> The Decree read as follows : </P> <P> The Coup of General Kornilov is suppressed . But the turmoil that he spread in the ranks of the army and in the country is great . Once again , a great danger threatens the fate of the country and its freedom . Considering it necessary to put an end to the uncertainty in the political system , and keeping in mind the unanimous and enthusiastic recognition of Republican ideas , which affected the Moscow State Conference , the Provisional Government announces that the state system of the Russian state is the republican system and proclaims the Russian Republic . Urgent need for immediate and decisive action to restore the shocked state system has prompted the Provisional Government to pass the power of government to five individuals from its staff , headed by the Prime Minister . The Provisional Government considers its main objective to be the restoration of public order and the fighting efficiency of the armed forces . Believing that only the concentration of all the surviving forces of the country can help the Motherland out of the difficulty in which it now finds itself , the Provisional Government will seek to expand its membership by attracting to its ranks all those who consider the eternal and general interests of the country more important than the short - term and particular needs of certain parties or classes . The Provisional Government has no doubt that it will succeed in this task in the days ahead . </P> <P> On 12 September ( 25 , N.S ) an All - Russian Democratic Conference was convened , and its presidium decided to create a Pre-Parliament and a Special Constituent Assembly which was to elaborate the future Constitution of Russia . This Constitutional Assembly was to be chaired by Professor N.I. Lazarev and the historian V.M. Gessen . The Provisional Government was expected to continue to administer Russia until the Constituent Assembly had determined the future form of government . On 16 September 1917 , the Duma was dissolved by the newly created Directorate . </P> <H2> October Revolution ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : October Revolution and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Milrevcom proclamation about the overthrowing of the Provisional Government <P> On 25 -- 26 October Red Guard forces under the leadership of Bolshevik commanders launched their final attack on the ineffectual Provisional Government . Most government offices were occupied and controlled by Bolshevik soldiers on the 25th ; the last holdout of the Provisional Ministers , the Tsar 's Winter Palace on the Neva River bank , was captured on the night of the 26th . Kerensky escaped the Winter Palace raid and fled to Pskov , where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the capital . His troops managed to capture Tsarskoe Selo but were beaten the next day at Pulkovo . Kerensky spent the next few weeks in hiding before fleeing the country . He went into exile in France and eventually emigrated to the U.S. </P> <P> The Bolsheviks then replaced the government with their own . The Little Council ( or Underground Provisional Government ) met at the house of Sofia Panina briefly in an attempt to resist the Bolsheviks . However this initiative ended on 28 November with the arrest of Panina , Fyodor Kokoshkin , Andrei Ivanovich Shingarev and Prince Pavel Dolgorukov and Panina being the subject of a political trial . </P> <P> Some academics , such as Pavel Osinsky , argue that the October Revolution was as much a function of the failures of the Provisional Government as it was of the strength of the Bolsheviks . Osinsky described this as `` socialism by default '' as opposed to `` socialism by design . '' </P> <P> Riasanovsky argued that the Provisional Government made perhaps its `` worst mistake '' by not holding elections to the Constituent Assembly soon enough . They wasted time fine - tuning details of the election law , while Russia slipped further into anarchy and economic chaos . By the time the Assembly finally met , Riasanovsky noted , `` the Bolsheviks had already gained control of Russia .

The Secretary of the Treasury was given broad latitude by Congress in 1862 to supervise the design , printing , and issue of banknotes . The Secretary , with input from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , has final approval over the design of banknotes . </P> <P> The redesign of U.S. banknotes in 1922 prompted the Treasury Department to review the portraits on banknotes and conclude that `` portraits of Presidents of the United States have a more permanent familiarity in the minds of the public than any others . '' Exceptions were made for Alexander Hamilton , Salmon Chase , and Benjamin Franklin . There have been no changes in the people depicted on currency intended for the general public since 1928 ; when Woodrow Wilson was depicted on the 1934 $100,000 gold certificate , the note was only for internal Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank use . </P> <P> Five people have been depicted on U.S. currency during their lifetime . Abraham Lincoln was portrayed on the 1861 $10 Demand Note ; Salmon Chase , Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury , approved his own portrait for the 1862 $1 Legal Tender Note ; Winfield Scott was depicted on Interest Bearing Notes during the early 1860s ; and Francis Spinner and Spencer Clark both approved the use of their own image on fractional currency . In 1873 , driven in large part by the actions of Spinner and Clark , Congress prohibited the use of portraits of living people on any U.S. bond , security , note , or fractional or postal currency . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Key to banknote type abbreviations </Li> <Li> 2 People depicted </Li> <Li> 3 Summary of titles / positions </Li> <Li> 4 Portraits on other American banknotes </Li> <Li> 5 References <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 5.2 Notes </Li> <Li> 5.3 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Key to banknote type abbreviations ( edit ) </H2> <P> Many of the 53 individuals were depicted on more than one note of a series or denomination . In the description of the banknotes , the date in parentheses indicates the individual 's first appearance on a given note type and denomination . When multiple banknotes are listed , the order , though seeming random , is in accordance with the Friedberg Number , in ascending Friedberg order .

As of September 2017 , CLS settles 18 currencies , has 79 shareholders , 66 settlement members and 24,000 + third - party clients . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Service <Ul> <Li> 1.1 How it works <Ul> <Li> 1.1. 1 In / Out Swaps </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.2 Currencies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 See also </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Service ( edit ) </H2> <P> CLS operates a global multi-currency cash settlement system through which settlement risk can be mitigated with finality using a combination of PvP settlement over CLS central bank accounts , local real - time gross settlements systems ( RTGS ) and multilateral payment netting supported by a resilient infrastructure . </P> <P> In a PvP system both sides ' payment instructions for a FX transaction are settled simultaneously . Without PvP there is a serious risk that one party to a FX transaction will deliver the currency it owes , but not receive the other currency from its counterparty , resulting in the loss of principal . This is known as settlement risk , or `` Herstatt Risk '' , after the German bank , Bankhaus Herstatt , which collapsed in June 1974 leaving many of its FX counterparties with significant losses . </P> <H3> How it works ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following an FX transaction , Settlement Members submit payment instructions to CLS . These instructions are authenticated and matched by CLS and maintained by the system until settlement date . The CLS daily settlement cycle operates with settlement and funding occurring during a five - hour window when all real time gross settlement ( RTGS ) systems in the CLS settlement currency jurisdictions are open and able to make and receive payments . This enables simultaneous settlement of the payments on both sides of a FX transaction . </P> <P> Each Settlement Member holds a single multi-currency account with CLS . At the start and end of a normal settlement day , each Settlement Member has a zero balance on its account . Under normal operations of the settlement service , CLS starts and ends the day with a zero balance in its central bank accounts and in its Settlement Member accounts . Settlement Members may submit instructions relating to their own FX transactions as well as the FX transactions of their third party customers directly to CLS . </P> <P> CLS holds accounts with each of the central banks whose currencies it settles . </P> <P> On each settlement date , upon determining that the accounts of the submitting Settlement Members satisfy several risk management tests , CLS simultaneously settles each pair of matched payment instructions by making the corresponding debit and credit entries in the Settlement Members ' accounts at CLS . The settlement of the payment instructions and the associated payments are final and irrevocable . </P> <P> For example , ( GBP / USD = 1.50 , EUR / USD = 1.25 ) : </P> <Ul> <Li> By trades : <Ul> <Li> Member 1 : Buys 1,000 GBP / USD from Member 2 </Li> <Li> Member 2 : Buys 1,000 EUR / USD from Member 3 </Li> <Li> Member 3 : Buys 1,000 GBP / USD from Member 1 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> By currency positions : <Ul> <Li> Member 1 : Owes USD1500 and GBP1000 , collects USD1500 and GBP1000 </Li> <Li> Member 2 : Owes USD1250 and GBP1000 , collects EUR1000 and USD1500 </Li> <Li> Member 3 : Owes USD1500 and EUR1000 , collects USD1250 and GBP1000 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> CLS then multi-laterally nets the total obligations : <Ul> <Li> Member 1 : Pays 0.0 and receives 0.0 </Li> <Li> Member 2 : Pays GBP1000 , and receives EUR1000 and USD250 </Li> <Li> Member 3 : Pays USD250 and EUR1000 , and receives GBP1000 </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> These obligations are funded into and from each member 's respective multi-currency account . </P> <P> Another key element of the CLS Settlement Service is the liquidity efficiencies delivered through multilateral payment netting . On each day participants will very likely have more than one trade to settle -- in practice , major banks will have hundreds or thousands of trades each day . Each day prior to settlement , CLS calculates the funding required of each Settlement Member on a multilateral netted basis . The amount of cash required by CLS to settle all payment instructions is reduced , allowing each Settlement Member to transfer only the net amount of its payment obligations in each currency , rather than the total amount of each trade to be settled . On average , CLS netting efficiency is in the region of 96 percent . </P> In / Out Swaps ( edit ) <P> In addition to the usual settlement service , the In / Out Swap process is done before the settlement windows to reduce the payment obligations to CLS and to mitigate liquidity pressures . An In / Out Swap is an intraday swap consisting of two equal and opposite FX transactions that are agreed as an intraday swap . </P> <P> One of the `` legs '' is settled inside CLS in order to reduce each Settlement Member 's net position in the two relevant currencies . The other `` leg '' is settled outside CLS . </P> <P> The In / Out Swap further compresses payment obligation by an average of 75 % , which results in a funding requirement in CLS of less than 1 % of the total gross settlement value . </P> <H3> Currencies ( edit ) </H3> <P> CLS has expanded the number of currencies it settles over the years and currently settles the following currencies : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Country / entity </Th> <Th> Symbol </Th> <Th> Currency </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia </Td> <Td> AUD </Td> <Td> Australian dollar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> CAD </Td> <Td> Canadian dollar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Denmark </Td> <Td> DKK </Td> <Td> Danish krone </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eurozone </Td> <Td> EUR </Td> <Td> Euro </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hong Kong </Td> <Td> HKD </Td> <Td> Hong Kong dollar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hungary </Td> <Td> HUF </Td> <Td> Hungarian forint </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Israel </Td> <Td> ILS </Td> <Td> Israeli new shekel </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Japan </Td> <Td> JPY </Td> <Td> Japanese yen </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mexico </Td> <Td> MXN </Td> <Td> Mexican peso </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand </Td> <Td> NZD </Td> <Td> New Zealand dollar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Norway </Td> <Td> NOK </Td> <Td> Norwegian krone </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Singapore </Td> <Td> SGD </Td> <Td> Singapore dollar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> South Africa </Td> <Td> ZAR </Td> <Td> South African rand </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> South Korea </Td> <Td> KRW </Td> <Td> South Korean won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sweden </Td> <Td> SEK </Td> <Td> Swedish krona </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Switzerland </Td> <Td> CHF </Td> <Td> Swiss franc </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> United Kingdom </Td> <Td> GBP </Td> <Td> Pound sterling </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> USD </Td> <Td> United States dollar </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Clearing ( finance ) </Li> <Li> Bank for International Settlements </Li> <Li> delivery versus payment </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` BIS report '' ( PDF ) .

      "context": "Stadion ( running race ) - wikipedia <H1> Stadion ( running race ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the ancient running event and building . For other uses , see Stadion ( disambiguation ) . The stadion of ancient Nemea , Greece . <P> Stadion or stade ( Ancient Greek : στάδιον ) was an ancient running event , part of the Ancient Olympic Games and the other Panhellenic Games . It was one of the five major Pentathlon events . It was the premier event of the gymnikos agon ( nude competition ) . From the years 776 to 724 BC , the stadion was the only event that took place at the Olympic Games . The victor gave his name to the entire four - year Olympiad , which has allowed scholars to know the names of nearly every ancient Olympic stadion winner . </P> <P> The stadion was named after the building in which it took place , also called the stadion . This word became stadium in Latin , which became the English word stadium . There were other types of running events , but the stadion was the most prestigious ; the winner was often considered to be the winner of an entire Games . Though a separate event , the stadion was also part of the ancient Pentathlon . </P> <P> At the Olympic Games , the stadion ( building ) was big enough for 20 competitors , and the race was a 200 yd ( 180 m ) sprint , but the original stadion track in Olympia measures approximately 210 yd ( 190 m ) . The race began with a trumpet blow , with officials ( the agonothetai - ἀγωνοθέται ) at the starting blocks to make sure there were no false starts . There were also officials at the end to decide on a winner and to make sure no one had cheated . If the officials decided there was a tie , the race would be re-run . Runners started the race from a standing position , probably with their arms stretched out in front of them , instead of starting in a crouch like modern runners . They ran naked on a packed earth track . By the fifth century , the track was marked by a stone - starting line , the balbis . Advancements in this stone starting block led to it having a set of double grooves ( 10 -- 12 cm ( 3.9 -- 4.7 in ) apart ) in which the runner placed his toes . The design of these grooves were intended to give the runner leverage for his start . </P> <P> The winner of the stadion in the first Olympic Games was Coroebus of Elis . </P> <P> The race gave its name to the unit of length , the Stadion . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Running in Ancient Greece </Li> <Li> Olympic winners of the Stadion race </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Miller , Stephen G.

It is over 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) wide ( from west to east ) and covers an area of 348,750 square kilometres ( 134,650 sq mi ) from the Eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia to the Gawler Ranges in South Australia . The Western Australia Mallee shrub ecoregion lies to the west , the Little Sandy Desert to the northwest , the Gibson Desert and the Central Ranges xeric shrublands to the north , the Tirari and Sturt Stony deserts to the east , while the Nullarbor Plain to the south separates it from the Southern Ocean . Average annual rainfall is low and irregular , ranging from 200 to 250 mm ( 7.9 to 9.8 in ) per year . Thunderstorms are relatively common in the Great Victoria Desert , with an average of 15 -- 20 thunderstorms per annum . Summer daytime temperatures range from 32 to 40 ° C ( 90 to 104 ° F ) while in winter , this falls to 18 to 23 ° C ( 64 to 73 ° F ) . </P> <H2> Habitation ( edit ) </H2> <P> The majority of people living in the region are Indigenous Australians from different groups including the Kogara , the Mirning and the Pitjantjatjara . It is the part of Australia with the most populous and most healthy indigenous population . Aboriginal populations have been increasing in this region . Young Indigenous adults from the Great Victoria Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture . </P> <P> Despite its isolated location the Great Victoria is bisected by very rough tracks including the Connie Sue Highway and the Anne Beadell Highway . </P> <P> Human activity has included some mining and nuclear weapons testing . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1875 , British explorer Ernest Giles became the first European to cross the desert . He named the desert after the then - reigning British monarch , Queen Victoria . In 1891 , David Lindsey 's expedition traveled across this area from north to south . Frank Hann was looking for gold in this area between 1903 and 1908 . Len Beadell explored the area in the 1960s . </P> <H2> Environment ( edit ) </H2> Serpentine Lakes , South Australia , 2011 <P> The Great Victoria desert is a World Wildlife Fund ecoregion and an Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia ( IBRA ) region of the same name . </P> <P> As this area has had very limited use for agriculture , habitats remain largely undisturbed while parts of the desert are protected areas including Mamungari Conservation Park ( formerly known as Unnamed Conservation Park ) in South Australia , a large area of pristine arid zone wilderness which possesses cultural significance and is one of the fourteen World Biosphere Reserves in Australia . Habitat is also preserved in the large Aboriginal local government area of Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara in South Australia and in the Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve of Western Australia . </P> <P> The nuclear weapons trials carried out by the United Kingdom at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and early 1960s have left areas contaminated with plutonium - 239 and other radioactive material . </P> <H3> Flora ( edit ) </H3> <P> Only the hardiest of plants can survive in much of this environment . Between the sand ridges there are areas of wooded steppe consisting of Eucalyptus gongylocarpa , Eucalyptus youngiana and mulga ( Acacia aneura ) shrubs scattered over areas of resilient spinifex grasses particularly Triodia basedowii . </P> <H3> Fauna ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wildlife adapted to these harsh conditions includes few large birds or mammals . However , the desert does sustain many types of lizard including the vulnerable great desert skink ( Egernia kintorei ) and a number of small marsupials including the endangered sandhill dunnart ( Sminthopsis psammophila ) and the crest - tailed mulgara ( Dasycercus cristicauda ) . One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands , as a number of the desert 's animals , including the southern marsupial mole ( Notoryctes typhlops ) , and the water - holding frog do . Birds include the chestnut - breasted whiteface ( Aphelocephala pectoralis ) found on the eastern edge of the desert and the malleefowl of Mamungari Conservation Park . Predators of the desert include the dingo ( as the desert is north of the Dingo Fence ) and two large monitor lizards , the perentie ( Varanus giganteus ) and the sand goanna ( Varanus gouldii ) . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Australia portal </Li> <Li> Geography portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Deserts of Australia </Li> <Li> List of deserts by area </Li> <Li> Nullarbor Plain </Li> <Li> Tallaringa Conservation Park </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Great Victoria Desert -- The Largest Desert in Australia .

The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 ( 10 & 11 Geo 6 c 30 ) , an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth ( later Commonwealth of Nations ) . India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor - general . The country , though , did not yet have a permanent constitution ; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935 . On 28 August 1947 , the Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution , with Dr BR Ambedkar as chairman . While India 's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule , the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution . A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Assembly on 4 November 1947 . The Assembly met , in sessions open to public , for 166 days , spread over a period of two years , 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution . After many deliberations and some modifications , the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand - written copies of the document ( one each in Hindi and English ) on 24 January 1950 .

      "question": "how many plane surfaces does a cylinder have",
      "context": "Cylinder - wikipedia <H1> Cylinder </H1> Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Cylinder ( disambiguation ) . An empty tin can <P> A cylinder ( from Greek κύλινδρος -- kulindros , `` roller , tumbler '' ) , has traditionally been a three - dimensional solid , one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes . It is the idealized version of a solid physical tin can having lids on top and bottom . </P> <P> This traditional view is still used in elementary treatments of geometry , but the advanced mathematical viewpoint has shifted to the infinite curvilinear surface and this is how a cylinder is now defined in various modern branches of geometry and topology . </P> <P> The shift in the basic meaning ( solid versus surface ) has created some ambiguity with terminology . It is generally hoped that context makes the meaning clear . In this article both points of view are presented and distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces , but keep in mind that in the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object , the right circular cylinder . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Solid cylinders <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Right circular cylinders </Li> <Li> 1.2 Cylindric sections </Li> <Li> 1.3 Volume </Li> <Li> 1.4 Surface area </Li> <Li> 1.5 Right circular hollow cylinder ( cylindrical shell ) </Li> <Li> 1.6 On the Sphere and Cylinder </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Cylindrical surfaces </Li> <Li> 3 Projective geometry </Li> <Li> 4 Prisms </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Solid cylinders ( edit ) </H2> <P> The definitions and results in this section are taken from the 1913 text , Plane and Solid Geometry by George Wentworth and David Eugene Smith ( Wentworth & Smith 1913 ) . </P> <P> A cylindrical surface is a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line . Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an element of the cylindrical surface . From a kinematics point of view , given a plane curve , called the directrix , a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line , called the generatrix , not in the plane of the directrix , moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix . Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface . </P> A right and an oblique circular cylinder <P> A solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a ( solid ) cylinder . The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an element of the cylinder . All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths . The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a base of the cylinder . The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures . If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases , the cylinder is a right cylinder , otherwise it is called an oblique cylinder . If the bases are disks ( regions whose boundary is a circle ) the cylinder is called a circular cylinder . In some elementary treatments , a cylinder always means a circular cylinder . </P> <P> The height ( or altitude ) of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between its bases . </P> <P> The cylinder obtained by rotating a line segment about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a cylinder of revolution . A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder . The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment . The line that the segment is revolved about is called the axis of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases . </P> A right circular cylinder with radius r and height h <H3> Right circular cylinders ( edit ) </H3> <P> The unmodified term cylinder often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis , that is , a right circular cylinder , as shown in the figure . If the ends are missing , it is called an open cylinder . The formulae for the surface area and the volume of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity . </P> <P> A right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides . These cylinders are used in an integration technique ( the `` disk method '' ) for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution . </P> <H3> Cylindric sections ( edit ) </H3> Cylindric section <P> A cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder 's surface with a plane . They are , in general , curves and are special types of plane sections . The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a parallelogram . Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a rectangle . </P> <P> A cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a right section . If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder . In more generality , if a right section of a cylinder is a conic section ( parabola , ellipse , hyperbola ) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic , elliptic or hyperbolic respectively . </P> Cylindric sections of a right circular cylinder <P> For a right circular cylinder , there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder . First , consider planes that intersect a base in at most one point . A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element . The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an ellipse . If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section . If such a plane contains two elements , it has a rectangle as a cylindric section , otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse . Finally , if a plane contains more than two points of a base , it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle . </P> <P> In the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse , the eccentricity e of the cylindric section and semi-major axis a of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder r and the angle α between the secant plane and cylinder axis , in the following way : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> e = cos ⁡ α , ( \\ displaystyle e = \\ cos \\ alpha , ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> a = r sin ⁡ α . ( \\ displaystyle a = ( \\ frac ( r ) ( \\ sin \\ alpha ) ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Volume ( edit ) </H3> <P> If the base of a circular cylinder has a radius r and the cylinder has height h , then its volume is given by </P> <Dl> <Dd> V = πr h . </Dd> </Dl> <P> This formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder . </P> <P> This formula may be established by using Cavalieri 's principle . </P> A solid elliptic cylinder with the semi-axes a and b for the base ellipse and height h <P> In more generality , by the same principle , the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height . For example , an elliptic cylinder with a base having semi-major axis a , semi-minor axis b and height h has a volume V = Ah , where A is the area of the base ellipse ( = πab ) . This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration , where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive x-axis and A ( x ) = A the area of each elliptic cross-section , thus : </P> <Dl> <Dd> V = ∫ 0 h A ( x ) d x = ∫ 0 h π a b d x = π a b ∫ 0 h d x = π a b h . ( \\ displaystyle V = \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( h ) A ( x ) dx = \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( h ) \\ pi abdx = \\ pi ab \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( h ) dx = \\ pi abh . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Using cylindrical coordinates , the volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated by integration over </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> = ∫ 0 h ∫ 0 2 π ∫ 0 r s d s d φ d z ( \\ displaystyle = \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( h ) \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( 2 \\ pi ) \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( r ) s \\ , \\ , ds \\ , d \\ phi \\ , dz ) </Dd> <Dd> = π r 2 h . ( \\ displaystyle = \\ pi \\ , r ^ ( 2 ) \\ , h . ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Surface area ( edit ) </H3> <P> Having radius r and altitude ( height ) h , the surface area of a right circular cylinder , oriented so that its axis is vertical , consists of three parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> the area of the top base : πr </Li> <Li> the area of the bottom base : πr </Li> <Li> the area of the side : 2πrh </Li> </Ul> <P> The area of the top and bottom bases is the same , and is called the base area , B . The area of the side is known as the lateral area , L . </P> <P> An open cylinder does not include either top or bottom elements , and therefore has surface area ( lateral area ) </P> <Dl> <Dd> L = 2πrh . </Dd> </Dl> <P> The surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components : top , bottom and side . Its surface area is therefore , </P> <Dl> <Dd> A = L + 2B = 2πrh + 2πr = 2πr ( h + r ) = πd ( r + h ) , </Dd> </Dl> <P> where d = 2r is the diameter of the circular top or bottom . </P> <P> For a given volume , the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has h = 2r . Equivalently , for a given surface area , the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has h = 2r , that is , the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle ) . </P> <P> The lateral area , L , of a circular cylinder , which need not be a right cylinder , is more generally given by : </P> <Dl> <Dd> L = e × p , </Dd> </Dl> <P> where e is the length of an element and p is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder . This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder . </P> Hollow cylinder <H3> Right circular hollow cylinder ( cylindrical shell ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> A right circular hollow cylinder ( or cylindrical shell ) is a three - dimensional region bounded by two right circular cylinders having the same axis and two parallel annular bases perpendicular to the cylinders ' common axis , as in the diagram . </P> <P> Let the height be h , internal radius r , and external radius R .

( \\ displaystyle A = 2 \\ pi ( R + r ) h + 2 \\ pi ( R ^ ( 2 ) - r ^ ( 2 ) ) . ) . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Cylindrical shells are used in a common integration technique for finding volumes of solids of revolution . </P> <H3> On the sphere and cylinder ( edit ) </H3> A sphere has 2 / 3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases Main article : On the Sphere and Cylinder <P> In the treatise by this name , written c. 225 BCE , Archimedes obtained the result of which he was most proud , namely obtaining the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere by exploiting the relationship between a sphere and its circumscribed right circular cylinder of the same height and diameter . The sphere has a volume two - thirds that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface area two - thirds that of the cylinder ( including the bases ) . Since the values for the cylinder were already known , he obtained , for the first time , the corresponding values for the sphere . The volume of a sphere of radius r is 4 / 3πr = 2 / 3 ( 2πr ) . The surface area of this sphere is 4πr = 2 / 3 ( 6πr ) . A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request . </P> <H2> Cylindrical surfaces ( edit ) </H2> <P> In some areas of geometry and topology the term cylinder refers to what we have called a cylindrical surface . To repeat , throughout this section a cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line . Such cylinders have , at times , been referred to as generalized cylinders . Through each point of a generalized cylinder there passes a unique line that is contained in the cylinder . Thus , this definition may be rephrased to say that a cylinder is any ruled surface spanned by a one - parameter family of parallel lines . </P> <P> A cylinder having a right section that is an ellipse , parabola , or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder , parabolic cylinder or hyperbolic cylinder , respectively . These are degenerate quadric surfaces . </P> Parabolic cylinder <P> The general equation of a quadric in three dimensions is given by </P> <Dl> <Dd> f ( x , y , z ) = A x 2 + B y 2 + C z 2 + D x + E y + G z + H = 0 , ( \\ displaystyle f ( x , y , z ) = Ax ^ ( 2 ) + By ^ ( 2 ) + Cz ^ ( 2 ) + Dx + Ey + Gz + H = 0 , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> with the coefficients being real numbers and not all of A , B and C being 0 . If at least one variable does not appear in the equation , then the quadric is degenerate . If one variable is missing , we may assume by an appropriate rotation of axes that the variable z does not appear and the general equation of this type of degenerate quadric can be written as </P> <Dl> <Dd> A ( x + D 2 A ) 2 + B ( y + E 2 B ) 2 = ρ , ( \\ displaystyle A \\ left ( x+ ( \\ frac ( D ) ( 2A ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) + B \\ left ( y+ ( \\ frac ( E ) ( 2B ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) = \\ rho , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> where </P> <Dl> <Dd> ρ = − H + D 2 4 A + E 2 4 B . ( \\ displaystyle \\ rho = - H+ ( \\ frac ( D ^ ( 2 ) ) ( 4A ) ) + ( \\ frac ( E ^ ( 2 ) ) ( 4B ) ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> If AB > 0 this is the equation of an elliptic cylinder . Further simplification can be obtained by translation of axes and scalar multiplication . If ρ ( \\ displaystyle \\ rho ) has the same sign as the coefficients A and B , then the equation of an elliptic cylinder may be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as : </P> <Dl> <Dd> ( x a ) 2 + ( y b ) 2 = 1 . ( \\ displaystyle \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( x ) ( a ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) + \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( y ) ( b ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) = 1 . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> This equation of an elliptic cylinder is a generalization of the equation of the ordinary , circular cylinder ( a = b ) . Elliptic cylinders are also known as cylindroids , but that name is ambiguous , as it can also refer to the Plücker conoid . </P> <P> If ρ ( \\ displaystyle \\ rho ) has a different sign than the coefficients , we obtain the imaginary elliptic cylinders : </P> <Dl> <Dd> ( x a ) 2 + ( y b ) 2 = − 1 , ( \\ displaystyle \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( x ) ( a ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) + \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( y ) ( b ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) = - 1 , ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> which have no real points on them . ( ρ = 0 ( \\ displaystyle \\ rho = 0 ) gives a single real point . ) </P> <P> If A and B have different signs and ρ ≠ 0 ( \\ displaystyle \\ rho \\ neq 0 ) , we obtain the hyperbolic cylinders , whose equations may be rewritten as : </P> <Dl> <Dd> ( x a ) 2 − ( y b ) 2 = 1 . ( \\ displaystyle \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( x ) ( a ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) - \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( y ) ( b ) ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) = 1 . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Finally , if AB = 0 assume , without loss of generality , that B = 0 and A = 1 to obtain the parabolic cylinders with equations that can be written as : </P> <Dl> <Dd> x 2 + 2 a y = 0 . ( \\ displaystyle ( x ) ^ ( 2 ) + 2a ( y ) = 0 . ) </Dd> </Dl> In projective geometry , a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity , which corresponds visually to a cylinder in perspective appearing to be a cone towards the sky . <H2> Projective geometry ( edit ) </H2> <P> In projective geometry , a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex ( vertex ) lies on the plane at infinity . If the cone is a quadratic cone , the plane at infinity passing through the vertex can intersect the cone at two real lines , a single real line ( actually a coincident pair of lines ) , or only at the vertex . These cases give rise to the hyperbolic , parabolic or elliptic cylinders respectively . </P> <P> This concept is useful when considering degenerate conics , which may include the cylindrical conics . </P> <H2> Prisms ( edit ) </H2> Tycho Brahe Planetarium building , Copenhagen , is an example of a truncated cylinder <P> A solid circular cylinder can be seen as the limiting case of a n - gonal prism where n approaches infinity . The connection is very strong and many older texts treat prisms and cylinders simultaneously . Formulas for surface area and volume are derived from the corresponding formulas for prisms by using inscribed and circumscribed prisms and then letting the number of sides of the prism increase without bound . Indeed , one reason for the early emphasis ( and sometimes exclusive treatment ) on circular cylinders is that a circular base is the only type of geometric figure for which this technique works with the use of only elementary considerations ( no appeal to calculus or more advanced mathematics ) . Terminology about prisms and cylinders is identical . Thus , for example , since a truncated prism is a prism whose bases do not lie in parallel planes , a solid cylinder whose bases do not lie in parallel planes would be called a truncated cylinder . </P> <P> From a polyhedral viewpoint , a cylinder can also be seen as a dual of a bicone as an infinite - sided bipyramid . </P> <Table> Family of uniform prisms <Tr> <Th> Polyhedron </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Coxeter </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Tiling </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Config . </Th> <Th> 3.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 4.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 5.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 6.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 7.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 8.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 9.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 10.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 11.4. 4 </Th> <Th> 12.4. 4 </Th> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Steinmetz solid , the intersection of two or three perpendicular cylinders </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ κύλινδρος , Henry George Liddell , Robert Scott , A Greek - English Lexicon , on Perseus </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jacobs , Harold R.

      "context": "United Kingdom and the American Civil war - wikipedia <H1> United Kingdom and the American Civil war </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> The United Kingdom ( the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ) remained officially neutral throughout the American Civil War ( 1861 -- 1865 ) . It legally recognised the belligerent status of the Confederate States of America ( CSA ) but never recognised it as a nation and neither signed a treaty with it nor exchanged ambassadors . Over 90 percent of Confederate trade with Britain ended , causing a severe shortage of cotton by 1862 . Britain financed blockade runners that sent munitions and luxuries to Confederate ports in return for cotton and tobacco . Top British officials debated offering to mediate in the first 18 months , which the CSA wanted but the U.S. strongly rejected . </P> <P> The British elite tended to support the Confederacy , but ordinary people tended to support the United States . Large - scale trade continued between Britain and the U.S. : The U.S. shipped grain to Britain and Britain sent manufactured items and munitions . Immigration continued into the US , with many Britons volunteering for its army . British trade with the Confederacy fell over 90 % from the prewar period , with a small amount of cotton going to Britain and some munitions and luxury goods slipped in by numerous small blockade runners . They were operated and funded by British private interests . They were legal under international law , and caused no dispute between the US and the UK . </P> <P> The Confederate strategy for securing independence was based largely on the hope of military intervention by Britain and France . That never happened because it probably would have caused war with the US , and would have cut off much of Britain 's food supply . A serious diplomatic dispute erupted over the `` Trent Affair '' in late 1861 but was resolved peacefully after five weeks . British intervention was likely only in co-operation with France , which had an imperialistic venture underway in Mexico . By early 1863 , intervention was no longer seriously considered , as Britain turned its attention elsewhere , especially toward Russia and Greece . </P> <P> A long - term issue was sales of warships to the CSA . A British shipyard ( John Laird and Sons ) built two warships for the Confederacy , including the CSS Alabama , over vehement protests from the US . Known as the Alabama Claims , the controversy was resolved peacefully after the Civil War when the US was awarded $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by the warships . </P> <P> The fact that British private interests operated blockade runners was not a cause of serious tension . In the end , British involvement did not significantly affect the outcome of the war . The U.S. diplomatic mission headed by Minister Charles Francis Adams , Sr. , proved much more successful than the Confederate missions , which were never officially recognized by Britain . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Confederate policies </Li> <Li> 2 Union policies </Li> <Li> 3 British policies </Li> <Li> 4 Slavery </Li> <Li> 5 Trent Affair </Li> <Li> 6 Possibility of recognizing Confederacy </Li> <Li> 7 Emancipation Proclamation </Li> <Li> 8 Confederate diplomacy </Li> <Li> 9 Postwar adjustments and Alabama claims </Li> <Li> 10 Long - term impact </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> <H2> Confederate policies ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Diplomacy of the American Civil War <P> The Confederacy , such as President Jefferson Davis , believed from the beginning in `` King Cotton '' : British dependence on cotton for its large textile industry would lead to diplomatic recognition and mediation or military intervention . The Confederates had not sent out agents ahead of time to ascertain if the King Cotton policy would be effective . Instead , by popular demand , not government action , shipments of cotton to Europe were ended in spring 1861 . When the Confederate diplomats arrived , they tried to convince British leaders that the US naval blockade was an illegal paper blockade . Historian Charles Hubbard writes : </P> <Dl> <Dd> `` Davis left foreign policy to others in government and , rather than developing an aggressive diplomatic effort , tended to expect events to accomplish diplomatic objectives . The new president was committed to the notion that cotton would secure recognition and legitimacy from the powers of Europe . The men Davis selected as secretary of state and emissaries to Europe were chosen for political and personal reasons -- not for their diplomatic potential . This was due , in part , to the belief that cotton could accomplish the Confederate objectives with little help from Confederate diplomats . '' </Dd> </Dl> <P> Hubbard added that Davis 's policy was stubborn and coercive . The King Cotton strategy was resisted by the Europeans . Secretary of War Judah Benjamin and Secretary of the Treasury Christopher Memminger warned that cotton should be immediately exported to build up foreign credits . </P> <H2> Union policies ( edit ) </H2> U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward ( c. 1850 ) Main article : Diplomacy of the American Civil War British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston <P> The Union 's main goal in foreign affairs was to maintain friendly relations and large - scale trade with the world and to prevent any official recognition of the Confederacy by any country , especially Britain . Other concerns included preventing the Confederacy from buying foreign - made warships ; gaining European support for policies against slavery ; and attracting immigrant laborers , farmers and soldiers . There had been continuous improvement in Anglo - American relations throughout the 1850s . The issues of Oregon , Texas , and the Canada -- US border had all been resolved , and trade was brisk . Secretary of State William H. Seward , the primary architect of American foreign policy during the war , intended to maintain the policy principles that had served the country well since the American Revolution : `` non-intervention by the United States in the affairs of other countries and resistance to foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States and other countries in this hemisphere . '' </P> <H2> British policies ( edit ) </H2> <P> British public opinion was divided on the American Civil War . The Confederacy tended to have support from the elites -- from the aristocracy and gentry , which identified with the landed plantation owners , and from Anglican clergy and some professionals who admired tradition , hierarchy and paternalism . The Union was favored by the middle classes , the Nonconformists in religion , intellectuals , reformers and most factory workers , who saw slavery and forced labor as a threat to the status of the workingman . The cabinet made the decisions . Chancellor of the Exchequer William E Gladstone , whose family fortune was based on slavery in the West Indies before 1833 , supported the Confederacy . Foreign Minister Lord Russell wanted neutrality . Prime Minister Lord Palmerston wavered between support for national independence , his opposition to slavery , and the strong economic advantages of Britain remaining neutral . </P> <P> Even before the war started , Lord Palmerston pursued a policy of neutrality . His international concerns were centred in Europe , where he had to watch both Napoleon III 's ambitions in Europe and Otto von Bismarck 's rise in Prussia . There were also serious problems involving Italy , Poland , Russia , Denmark and China . British reactions to American events were shaped by past British policies and their own national interests , both strategically and economically . In the Western Hemisphere , as relations with the United States improved , Britain had become cautious about confronting it over issues in Central America . As a naval power , Britain had a long record of insisting that neutral nations abide by its blockades , a perspective that led from the earliest days of the war to de facto support for the Union blockade and frustration in the South . </P> <P> Diplomatic observers were suspicious of British motives . The Russian Minister in Washington , Eduard de Stoeckl , noted , `` The Cabinet of London is watching attentively the internal dissensions of the Union and awaits the result with an impatience which it has difficulty in disguising . '' '' De Stoeckl advised his government that Britain would recognize the Confederacy at its earliest opportunity . Cassius Clay , the United States Minister in Russia , stated , `` I saw at a glance where the feeling of England was . They hoped for our ruin ! They are jealous of our power . They care neither for the South nor the North . They hate both . '' </P> <P> Lincoln appointed Charles Francis Adams , Sr. , as minister to Britain . An important part of his mission was to make clear to the British that the war was strictly an internal insurrection and afforded the Confederacy no rights under international law . Any movement by Britain to recognizing the Confederacy officially would be considered an unfriendly act toward the US . Seward 's instructions to Adams included the suggestion that it should be made clear to Britain that a nation with widely scattered possessions , as well as a homeland that included Scotland and Ireland , should be very wary of `` set ( ting ) a dangerous precedent . '' </P> <P> Lord Lyons was appointed as the British minister to the United States in April 1859 . An Oxford graduate , he had two decades of diplomatic experience before being given the American post . Lyons , like many British leaders , had reservations about Seward and shared them freely in his correspondence , which was widely circulated within the British government . As early as January 7 , 1861 , well before the Lincoln administration had even assumed office , Lyons wrote to British Foreign Secretary Lord Russell about Seward : </P> <P> I can not help fearing that he will be a dangerous foreign minister . His view of the relations between the United States and Britain had always been that they are a good material to make political capital of ... I do not think Mr. Seward would contemplate actually going to war with us , but he would be well disposed to play the old game of seeking popularity here by displaying violence toward us . </P> <P> Despite his distrust of Seward , throughout 1861 , Lyons maintained a `` calm and measured '' diplomacy that contributed to a peaceful resolution to the Trent crisis . </P> <H2> Slavery ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Confederate States came into existence after seven of the fifteen slave states seceded because of the election of Republican President Lincoln , whose party committed to the containment of slavery geographically and the weakening of slaveowners ' political power . Slavery was the cornerstone of the South 's plantation economy , although it was repugnant to the moral sensibilities of most people in Britain , which had abolished slavery in its Empire in 1833 . Until the Fall of 1862 , the immediate end of slavery was not an issue in the war ; in fact , some Union states ( Kentucky , Maryland , Missouri , Delaware , and what became West Virginia ) allowed slavery . In 1861 , Missouri had sought to extradite an escaped slave from Canada to face trial for a murder committed in his flight for which some in Britain falsely believed the punishment was to be burned alive . </P> <P> Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation , announced in preliminary form in September 1862 , made ending slavery an objective of the war and caused European intervention on the side of the South to be unpopular . However , some British leaders expected it would cause a large scale race war that might need foreign intervention . Pro-Southern leaders in Britain then spoke of mediation , which they understood to mean the independence of the Confederacy and the continuation of slavery . </P> <H2> Trent Affair ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Trent Affair <P> Outright war was a possibility in late 1861 , when the U.S. Navy took control of a British mail ship and seized two Confederate diplomats . Confederate President Jefferson Davis had named James M. Mason and John Slidell as commissioners to represent Confederate interests in England and France . They went to Havana , in Spanish Cuba , where they took passage for England on the British mail steamer Trent . The American warship USS San Jacinto under Captain Charles Wilkes was looking for them . It was generally then agreed that a nation at war had the right to stop and search a neutral merchant ship if it suspected that ship of carrying the enemy 's dispatches . Mason and Slidell , Wilkes reasoned , were in effect Confederate dispatches and so he had the right to remove them . On November 8 , 1861 , he fired twice across the bow of the Trent , sent a boat 's crew aboard , seized the Confederate commissioners , and bore them off in triumph to the US , where they were held prisoner in Boston . Wilkes was hailed as a national hero . </P> <P> The violation of British neutral rights triggered an uproar in Britain . Britain sent 11,000 troops to Canada , the British fleet was put on a war footing , with plans to capture New York City if war broke out , and a sharp note was dispatched to Washington to demand return of the prisoners and an apology . Lincoln , concerned about Britain entering the war , ignored anti-British sentiment and issued what the British interpreted as an apology , without apologizing , and ordered the prisoners to be released . </P> Britain 's shortage of cotton was partially made up by imports from India and Egypt ; Punch cartoon 16 November 1861 <P> War was unlikely in any event , as the United States was providing Britain with over 40 % of its wheat ( `` corn '' ) imports during the war years , and suspension would have caused severe disruption to its food supply . Britain imported about 25 - 30 % of its grain , and poor crops in 1861 and 1862 in France made Britain even more dependent on shiploads from New York City . Furthermore , British banks and financial institutions in the City of London had financed many projects such as railways in the US . There were fears that war would result in enormous financial losses as investments were lost and loans defaulted on . </P> <P> Britain 's shortage of cotton was partially made up by imports from India and Egypt by 1863 . The Trent Affair led to the Lyons - Seward Treaty of 1862 , an agreement to clamp down hard on the Atlantic slave trade by using the US Navy and the Royal Navy . </P> <H2> Possibility of recognizing Confederacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The possibility of recognizing the Confederacy came to the fore late in the summer of 1862 . At that time , as far as any European could see , the war seemed to be a stalemate . The US attempt to capture the Confederate capital had failed , and in the east and west alike , the Confederates were on the offensive . Charles Francis Adams , Sr. , warned Washington that the British government might very soon offer to mediate the difficulty between North and South , which would be a polite but effective way of intimating that in the opinion of Britain , the fight had gone on long enough and should be ended by giving the South what it wanted . Recognition , as Adams warned , risked all - out war with the United States . War would involve an invasion of Canada , a full - scale American attack on British shipping interests worldwide , an end to American grain shipments that were providing a large part of the British food supply , and an end to British sales of machinery and supplies to the US . The British leadership , however , thought that if the Union armies were decisively defeated , the US might soften its position and accept mediation . </P> <P> Earl Russell , British Foreign Secretary , had given Mason no encouragement , but after news of the Second Battle of Bull Run reached London in early September , Palmerston agreed that in late September , there could be a cabinet meeting at which Palmerston and Russell would ask approval of the mediation proposal . Then , Russell and Palmerston decided not to bring the plan before the cabinet until they got further word about Lee 's invasion of the North . If the Northerners were beaten , the proposal would go through ; if Lee failed , it might be well to wait a little longer before taking any action . </P> <P> The British working - class population , most notably the British cotton workers who suffered the Lancashire Cotton Famine , remained consistently opposed to the Confederacy . A resolution of support was passed by the inhabitants of Manchester and sent to Lincoln . His letter of reply has become famous : </P> <P> I know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the working people of Manchester and in all Europe are called to endure in this crisis . It has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this Government which was built on the foundation of human rights , and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of slavery , was likely to obtain the favor of Europe . </P> <P> Through the action of disloyal citizens , the working people of Europe have been subjected to a severe trial for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt . Under the circumstances I can not but regard your decisive utterances on the question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country . It is indeed an energetic and re-inspiring assurance of the inherent truth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice , humanity and freedom . </P> <P> I hail this interchange of sentiments , therefore , as an augury that , whatever else may happen , whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own , the peace and friendship which now exists between the two nations will be , as it shall be my desire to make them , perpetual . </P> <P> -- Abraham Lincoln , 19 January 1863 </P> <P> There is now a statue of Lincoln in Manchester , with an extract from his letter carved on the plinth . </P> <P> Lincoln became a hero amongst the British working class with progressive views . His portrait , often alongside that of Garibaldi , adorned many parlour walls . One can still be seen in the boyhood home of David Lloyd George , now part of the Lloyd George Museum . </P> <P> The decisive factor , in the fall of 1862 and increasingly thereafter was the Battle of Antietam and what grew out of it . Lee 's invasion was a failure at Antietam , and he barely escaped back to Virginia . It was now obvious that no final , conclusive Confederate triumph could be anticipated . The swift recession of the high Confederate tide was as visible in Britain as in America , and in the end , Palmerston and Russell dropped any notion of bringing a mediation - recognition program before the cabinet . </P> <H2> Emancipation Proclamation ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the late spring and early summer of 1862 , Lincoln had come to see that he must broaden the base of the war . The Union itself was not enough ; the undying vitality and drive of Northern anti-slavery men must be brought into full , vigorous support of the war effort and so the United States chose to declare itself officially against slavery . The Lincoln administration believed that slavery was the basis of the Confederate economy and leadership class and that victory required its destruction . Lincoln had drafted a plan and waited for a battlefield victory to announce it . The Battle of Antietam gave Lincoln victory , and on September 22 , he gave the Confederacy 100 days notice to return to the Union or else on January 1 , 1863 , all slaves held in areas in rebellion would be free . William Ewart Gladstone , the Chancellor of the Exchequer and a senior Liberal leader was accepting toward slavery in his youth ; his family had grown wealthy through the ownership of slaves in the West Indies , however , the idea of slavery was abhorrent to him with his idea of civilising all nations . He strongly spoke out for Confederate independence . When the Emancipation Proclamation was announced , he tried to make the counterargument that an independent Confederacy would do a better job of freeing the slaves than an invading northern army would . He warned that a race war was imminent and would justify British intervention . Emancipation also alarmed the British Foreign Secretary Lord John Russell , who expected a bloody slave uprising . The question then would be British intervention on humanitarian grounds . However , there was no slave uprising and no race war . The advice of the war minister against going to war with United States , and the tide of British public opinion , convinced the cabinet to take no action . </P> <H2> Confederate Diplomacy ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Cotton diplomacy <P> Once the war with the US began , the best hope for the survival of the Confederacy was military intervention by Britain and France . The US realized that as well and made it clear that recognition of the Confederacy meant war and the end of food shipments into Britain . The Confederates who had believed in `` King Cotton '' ( Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton for its industries ) were proven wrong . Britain , in fact , had ample stores of cotton in 1861 and depended much more on grain from the US . </P> <P> During its existence , the Confederate government sent repeated delegations to Europe ; historians do not give them high marks for diplomatic skills . James M. Mason was sent to London as Confederate minister to Queen Victoria , and John Slidell was sent to Paris as minister to Napoleon III . Both were able to obtain private meetings with high British and French officials , but they failed to secure official recognition for the Confederacy . Britain and the US were at sword 's point during the Trent Affair in late 1861 . Mason and Slidell had been illegally seized from a British ship by an American warship . Queen Victoria 's husband , Prince Albert , helped calm the situation , and Lincoln released Mason and Slidell and so the episode was no help to the Confederacy . </P> <P> Throughout the early years of the war , British foreign secretary Lord Russell , Napoleon III , and , to a lesser extent , British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston , explored the risks and advantages of recognition of the Confederacy or at least offering a mediation . Recognition meant certain war with the US , loss of American grain , loss of exports , loss of investments in American securities , potential invasion of Canada and other North American colonies , higher taxes , and a threat to the British merchant marine with little to gain in return . Many party leaders and the general public wanted no war with such high costs and meager benefits . Recognition was considered following the Second Battle of Manassas , when the British government was preparing to mediate in the conflict , but the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam and Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation , combined with internal opposition , caused the government to back away . </P> <P> In 1863 , the Confederacy expelled all foreign consuls ( all of them British or French diplomats ) for advising their subjects to refuse to serve in combat against the US . </P> <P> Throughout the war , all European powers adopted a policy of neutrality , meeting informally with Confederate diplomats but withholding diplomatic recognition . None ever sent an ambassador or official delegation to Richmond . However , they applied principles of international law and recognized both sides as belligerents . Canada allowed both Confederate and Union agents to work openly within its borders . </P> <H2> Postwar adjustments and Alabama claims ( edit ) </H2> <P> Northerners were outraged at British tolerance of non-neutral acts , especially the building of warships . The United States demanded vast reparations for the damages caused by British - built commerce raiders , especially CSS Alabama , which Palmerston bluntly refused to pay . </P> <P> The dispute continued for years after the war . After Palmerston 's death , Prime Minister Gladstone agreed to include the US war claims in treaty discussions on other pending issues , such as fishing rights and border disputes . In 1872 , pursuant to the resultant Treaty of Washington , an international arbitration board awarded $15,500,000 to the US , and the British apologized for the destruction caused by the British - built Confederate ships but admitted no guilt . </P> <H2> Long - term Impact ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Union victory emboldened the forces in Britain that demanded more democracy and public input into the political system . The resulting Reform Act 1867 enfranchised the urban male working class in England and Wales and weakened the upper - class landed gentry , who identified more with the Southern planters . Influential commentators included Walter Bagehot , Thomas Carlyle , John Stuart Mill , and Anthony Trollope . Additionally , many Irishmen saw service in both the Union and Confederate State Army . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> American Civil War portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> France in the American Civil War </Li> <Li> Canada in the American Civil War </Li> <Li> Bahamas in the American Civil War </Li> <Li> Blockade runners of the American Civil War </Li> <Li> Timeline of British diplomatic history </Li> <Li> International relations ( 1814 -- 1919 ) </Li> <Li> Foreign enlistment in the American Civil War </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Boleslaw Adam Boczek ( 2005 ) .

She has a turbulent relationship with husband Garry ( Ricky Groves ) , but despite her complaints about him , it ends up being Lynne 's adultery that puts their relationship in jeopardy long before Garry strays . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Storylines <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Backstory </Li> <Li> 1.2 2000 -- 2004 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Creation and development </Li> <Li> 3 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Backstory ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lynne is the eldest of the Slater sisters and she arrives in Albert Square in 2000 with her family : father Charlie ( Derek Martin ) ; sisters Kat ( Jessie Wallace ) , Little Mo ( Kacey Ainsworth ) and Zoe ( Michelle Ryan ) , and grandmother Mo ( Laila Morse ) . Unlike Little Mo and Zoe , Lynne is aware that Zoe is in fact Kat 's daughter and helps keep the family secret until Kat reveals the truth to Zoe . </P> <H3> 2000 -- 2004 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lynne is in a relationship with hapless mechanic Garry Hobbs ( Ricky Groves ) and spends much of her time despairing over Garry 's inability to fully commit to their relationship . All Lynne really wants is to marry Garry , settle down and raise a family but while Garry loves Lynne , he is reluctant to lose his `` bachelor status '' and he spends much of his time dodging Lynne 's ' hints ' about marriage . However , Lynne ( and the rest of the Slaters ) wear Garry down and the two eventually get engaged . Lynne works in Ian Beale 's ( Adam Woodyatt ) café and often clashes with co-worker , Janine Butcher ( Charlie Brooks ) , who regularly slacks off work and flirts with Garry to irritate her . This culminates in Lynne eventually getting Janine fired and the two become enemies thereafter . </P> <P> In 2001 , Lynne becomes friends with womanising club owner Beppe di Marco ( Michael Greco ) and she often babysits his son , Joe ( Jake Kyprianou ) . Lynne and Beppe soon become attracted to each other and have sex on the eve of Lynne 's wedding to Garry . Beppe feels Garry does not deserve Lynne and tries to stop Lynne marrying him by turning up at the register office and starting a fight with Garry . Lynne is tempted but goes through with the wedding . Beppe sends Steve Owen ( Martin Kemp ) to give her a note , but he throws it away . The marriage does not go smoothly , however , and in 2002 Lynne strays again , this time with ex-lover Jason James ( Joseph Millson ) . Jason is Lynne 's ex-fiancé , who jilted her on their wedding day and fled to Dubai . After a chance meeting , the two rekindle their relationship as Jason wants to reconcile and almost persuades her to leave Garry and move away with him . However , at the last minute , Lynne changes her mind and chooses to stay with her family instead of following her heart . Garry forgives Lynne as he is desperate to hang onto her but the trust has gone from their relationship . </P> <P> In 2003 , another affair jeopardises Lynne 's marriage , but this time it is Garry who strays . Garry has drunken sex with Laura Beale ( Hannah Waterman ) and she gets pregnant . Laura 's husband , Ian , reveals to her that he has had a vasectomy so the baby can not be his and throws her out so she turns to Garry for support , thinking he is her baby 's father . Lynne has been trying for a baby and struggles to forgive Garry for having a baby with another woman , throwing him out so he moves in with Laura to support her during her pregnancy . Lynne finally comes round and forgives Garry after she gets jealous when he has sex with Lynne 's sister , Belinda Peacock ( Leanne Lakey ) . </P> <P> Lynne and Garry reconcile and in 2004 , Lynne becomes pregnant and a scan confirms that she is expecting a girl , that they plan to name her Vivienne after Lynne 's late mother , Viv ( April Martin ) . However , disaster strikes when a fairground ride collapses in Albert Square and Lynne is trapped under the debris . She survives but suffers severe abdominal pain and Garry is told that Lynne needs an emergency caesarian to save her and the baby . Terrified of losing Lynne and their daughter , Garry agrees but only Lynne survives . The baby is stillborn but Lynne also needed an emergency hysterectomy so she can not have any more children . When Lynne is told the tragic news , she is devastated and blames Garry for consenting to surgery and can not even bring herself to look at him . On the day of Vivienne 's funeral , Lynne decides that her marriage to Garry is over , feeling that life for her in Walford is simply a reminder of what she has lost . She leaves that day to go and stay with her aunt Jean and her departure leaves Garry a broken man . Lynne 's last appearance is in July 2004 . </P> <P> Lynne and Garry divorce and in 2007 , the Slaters hear that Lynne is engaged . In January 2011 , Charlie leaves Walford to live with Lynne . In January 2016 , Lynne attends Charlie 's funeral off - screen . </P> <H2> Creation and development ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2000 , EastEnders ' executive producer John Yorke decided to introduce the `` classic '' Slater family . He felt the show needed to go back to its roots and bring back some traditional values . BBC 's head of drama , Mal Young commented , `` We do not have enough solid families in the soap , there were a lot of fractured families and people who were alone . '' The family were created as a replacement for the di Marco family , who were axed by Yorke . The family consisted of , grandmother Mo Harris ( Laila Morse ) , father Charlie ( Derek Martin ) , his four children , Lynne ( Elaine Lordan ) , Kat ( Jessie Wallace ) , Little Mo ( Kacey Ainsworth ) , Zoe ( Michelle Ryan ) , as well as Lynne 's boyfriend Garry Hobbs ( Ricky Groves ) . It later transpired that Kat was the mother of Zoe , after being raped by her uncle Harry Slater ( Michael Elphick ) . </P> <P> Lordan was cast in the role of Lynne after the character was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year . The character was described as `` feisty '' , `` a loud mouth '' and `` lazy '' . </P> <P> On 15 December 2003 , it was announced that Lynne would be departing the following year . The decision was a mutual decision between Lordan and show producers and Lynne departed in July 2004 . </P> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> The character of Lynne Hobbs has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show 2DTV . </P> <P> Also , impressionist Alistair McGowan has impersonated Lynne working in the cafe , in his comedy show , The Big Impression . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Seven move in to Albert Square '' .

In other sources , he is said to have introduced the first principal actor in addition to the chorus . </P> <P> Thespis was a singer of dithyrambs ( songs about stories from mythology with choric refrains ) . He is credited with introducing a new style in which one singer or actor performed the words of individual characters in the stories , distinguishing between the characters with the aid of different masks . </P> <P> This new style was called tragedy , and Thespis was the most popular exponent of it . Eventually , in 534 BC competitions to find the best tragedy were instituted at the City Dionysia in Athens , and Thespis won the first documented competition . Capitalising on his success , Thespis also invented theatrical touring ; he would tour various cities while carrying his costumes , masks and other props in a horse - drawn wagon . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Alleged works </Li> <Li> 2 Legacy </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Sources </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Alleged works ( edit ) </H2> <P> Titles of some plays have been attributed to Thespis .

In fact , Thespis is the first known actor in written plays . He may thus have had a substantial role in changing the way stories were told and inventing theatre as we know it today . In reverence to Thespis , actors in the English - speaking part of the world have been referred to as thespians . </P> <P> Thespis was the title character in an 1871 comic opera by W.S.

      "context": "Volcanology of Iceland - wikipedia <H1> Volcanology of Iceland </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <Dl> <Dd> The volcano system in Iceland that started activity on August 17 , 2014 , and ended on February 27 , 2015 , is Bárðarbunga . </Dd> <Dd> The volcano in Iceland that erupted in May 2011 is Grímsvötn . </Dd> </Dl> Active volcanic areas and systems in Iceland <P> Volcanology of Iceland includes a high concentration of active volcanoes due to Iceland 's location on the mid-Atlantic Ridge , a divergent tectonic plate boundary , and also due to its location over a hot spot . The island has 30 active volcanic systems , of which 13 have erupted since the settlement of Iceland in AD 874 . </P> <P> Of these 30 active volcanic systems , the most active / volatile is Grímsvötn . Over the past 500 years , Iceland 's volcanoes have erupted a third of the total global lava output . </P> <P> The most fatal volcanic eruption of Iceland 's history was the so - called Skaftáreldar ( fires of Skaftá ) in 1783 - 84 . The eruption was in the crater row Lakagígar ( craters of Laki ) southwest of Vatnajökull glacier . The craters are a part of a larger volcanic system with the subglacial Grímsvötn as a central volcano . Roughly a quarter of the Icelandic nation died because of the eruption . Most died not because of the lava flow or other direct effects of the eruption , but from indirect effects , including changes in climate and illnesses in livestock in the following years caused by the ash and poisonous gases from the eruption . The 1783 eruption in Lakagígar is thought to have erupted the largest quantity of lava from a single eruption in historic times . </P> <P> The eruption under Eyjafjallajökull ( `` glacier of Eyjafjöll '' ) in 2010 was notable because the volcanic ash plume disrupted air travel in northern Europe for several weeks ; however this volcano is minor in Icelandic terms . In the past , eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull have been followed by eruption of the larger volcano Katla , but after the 2010 eruption no signs of an imminent eruption of Katla were seen . </P> <P> The eruption in May 2011 at Grímsvötn under the Vatnajökull glacier sent thousands of tonnes of ash into the sky in a few days , raising concerns of a repeat of the travel chaos seen across northern Europe . </P> The craters of Grábrók <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Bárðarbunga 2014 -- 2015 </Li> <Li> 2 Structure of lava fields </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Bárðarbunga 2014 -- 2015 ( edit ) </H2> Main article : 2014 -- 2015 eruption of Bárðarbunga <P> Bárðarbunga is a stratovolcano and is roughly 2,000 meters ( roughly 6,560 feet ) above sea level in central Iceland ( 64.63 ° N / - 17.53 ° W ) . This makes it the second highest mountain in Iceland </P> <P> The eruption series , Iceland 's largest eruption in 230 years , that started on August 17 , 2014 and lasted for 180 days , under the Bárðarbunga system started with an extremely heavy earthquake swarm followed by clusters of volcanic activity that went on for an extended period . This resulted in multiple lava fountain eruptions in Holuhraun . Lava flow was between 250 and 350 cubic meters per second and came from a dyke over 40 km long . An ice - filled subsidence bowl over 100 square kilometers in area and up to 65 meters deep formed as well . There was very limited ash output from this eruption unlike numerous glacial eruptions which are common in Iceland . The primary concern with this eruption was the large plumes of sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) in the atmosphere which adversely affected breathing conditions across Iceland , depending on wind direction . The volcanic cloud was also transported toward Western Europe in September 2014 . </P> <H2> Structure of lava fields ( edit ) </H2> Pahoehoe lava fields in Iceland <P> The smooth flowing basaltic lava pāhoehoe is in Iceland called helluhraun . It forms rather flat surfaces that are quite easy to pass . </P> A lava field in Iceland <P> On the other hand , there is less flowing lava , ʻaʻā , on Iceland called apalhraun . The loose , broken , sharp , spiny surface of an ʻaʻā flow makes hiking difficult and slow . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Lists of volcanoes </Li> <Li> Geography of Iceland </Li> <Li> List of volcanoes in Iceland </Li> <Li> Geothermal power in Iceland </Li> <Li> Surtsey </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Thordarson , Th ; Hoskuldsson , A ( 2008 ) . `` Postglacial Volcanism in Iceland '' .

The third U.S. President ( 1801 -- 09 ) , Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note . The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends and occasionally has created problems for people trying to use the bill to make purchases . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Denomination overview </Li> <Li> 2 Rarity </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Large - sized notes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Small size notes <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1928 -- 1966 </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1976 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Series dates <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Large size </Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 Small size </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Visual snapshot </Li> <Li> 5 Usage <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Lockheed U-2 </Li> <Li> 5.2 Incidents </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Uncut currency sheets </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Denomination overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act , and first used in March 1862 . The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s ; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two - dollar bill was assigned to . In 1966 it was decided to discontinue all United States Notes from production , which included the two - dollar bill . The two - dollar bill initially was not reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued ; the Treasury Department cited the two - dollar bill 's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination . In 1976 production of the two - dollar denomination was resumed and the two - dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note , with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull 's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello . It has remained a current denomination since then . It was estimated that if the two - dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one - dollar bills in circulation , the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ( $112 million adjusted for inflation ) over the period from 1976 to 1981 , due to reduced production , storage , and shipping costs . </P> <P> However , due to their limited use , two - dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series like other denominations , which are produced according to demand . Though some cash registers accommodate the bill , its slot is often used for things like checks and rolls of coins . Some bill acceptors found in vending machines , self checkout lanes , and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two - dollar bills , even if the fact is not stated on the label . Although they are generally available at most banks , two - dollar bills are usually not handed out arbitrarily except upon specific request by the customer , and even then , may cause a delay with a trip to the vault . </P> <H2> Rarity ( edit ) </H2> <P> The seeming rarity of a $2 bill can be attributed to its low printing numbers as a Federal Reserve Note . Hoarding of the series due to lack of public knowledge of the $2 bill has resulted in very few bills seen in circulation . After its initial release , supplies of the Series 1976 two - dollar bill were allowed to dwindle until August 1996 when a new series dated 1995 began to be printed . This series was only printed for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta . </P> <P> Today , there is a common misconception by the general public that the $2 bill is no longer being produced . According to the Treasury , it `` receives many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation '' . In response , the Treasury stated : `` The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations ... As of April 30 , 2007 there were $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide . '' </P> <P> Things such as unusual serial numbers ( example : A11111111A ) , and replacement notes designated by a star in the serial number can raise the collector value . `` Collectible '' two - dollar bills have been made and sold by coin dealers and others in recent years merely by adding colors and special graphics to regular issue bills by using computer printers . However , these bills are not authorized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( BEP ) and are not worth anything more than face value on the collectors ' market . </P> <P> Certain conventions and tourism / convention bureaus capitalize on the scarcity of $2 bills in circulation , encouraging convention attendees and tourists to spend $2 bills in order to illustrate to the host communities the economic impact that the conventions and tourism bring . Sometimes known as `` SpendTom '' campaigns , the $2 bills linger in the community as a constant reminder . Some campaigns encourage people to participate in a hunt for the bills in order to win prizes . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Large - sized notes ( edit ) </H3> First $2 bill issued in 1862 as a Legal Tender Note . Series 1886 $2 Silver Certificate depicting Winfield Scott Hancock Series 1890 featuring James McPherson . This `` Coin Note '' was used for government purchases of silver bullion from the mining industry . <P> ( approximately 7.4218 × 3.125 in ≅ 189 × 79 mm ) </P> <P> In March 1862 , the first $2 bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note ( United States Note ) with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton ; the portrait of Hamilton used was a profile view and is not the same portrait used currently for the $10 bill . The continental congress based on defending the United States , released on June 25 , 1776 , began to authorize $2 credit , the circulation of 49,000 copies . Pass two - dollar bill was first used in March 1862 . Between 1966 and 1976 , two - dollar notes were not printed . </P> <P> By 1869 , the $2 United States Note was redesigned with the now familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the left and a vignette of the United States Capitol in the center of the obverse . This note also featured green tinting on the top and left side of the obverse . Although this note is technically a United States Note , TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE . The reverse was completely redesigned . This series was again revised in 1874 , changes on the obverse included removing the green tinting , adding a red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. , and changing the term TREASURY NOTE to UNITED STATES NOTE . The 1874 design was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878 and by 1880 the red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. on the United States Note was removed and the serial numbers were changed to blue . This note with the red floral design was also issued as Series of 1917 but with red serial numbers by that time . </P> <P> National Bank Notes were issued in 1875 and feature a woman unfurling a flag and a big 2 ( Lazy Duce ) on the obverse , the reverse has the king of England smoking tobacco and an eagle with a shield . </P> The second two - dollar denomination in the silver certificate series printed in 1891 . This note features United States Secretary of the Treasury William Windom . <P> In 1886 , the first $2 silver certificate with a portrait of United States Civil War General Winfield Scott Hancock on the left of the obverse was issued . This design went on until 1891 when a new $2 Silver Certificate was issued with a portrait of U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom in the center of the obverse . </P> <P> Two - dollar Treasury , or `` Coin '' , Notes were first issued for government purchases of silver bullion in 1890 from the silver mining industry . The reverse featured large wording of TWO in the center and a numeral 2 to the right surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . In 1891 the reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too `` busy '' which would make it too easy to counterfeit . More open space was incorporated into the new design . </P> <P> In 1896 , the `` Educational Series '' Silver Certificate was issued . The entire obverse of the note was covered in artwork with an allegorical figure of science presenting steam and electricity to commerce and manufacture . The reverse of the note featured portraits of Robert Fulton and Samuel F.B. Morse surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . By 1899 , however , The $2 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a small portrait of George Washington surrounded by allegorical figures representing agriculture and mechanics . </P> Robert Fulton and Samuel Morse depicted on the reverse of the 1896 $2 ' Educational Series '' Silver Certificate . The final design of the United States ' silver certificate series featuring George Washington , printed in 1899 . <P> The only large - sized , Federal Reserve Note - like $2 bill was issued in 1918 as a Federal Reserve Bank Note . Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank . The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of Thomas Jefferson to left and wording in the entire center . The reverse featured a World War I battleship . </P> <P> Beginning in the 1950s , production of $2 bills began to decrease . The relative scarcity of the bills lead some to start saving any they found , with the inevitable result that the notes became rarer in circulation . Currently , the circulation of $2 bills accounts for around 1 % of the U.S. currency in circulation . </P> <H3> Small size notes ( edit ) </H3> <P> ( 6.14 × 2.61 in ≅ 156 × 66 mm ) </P> 1928 -- 1966 ( edit ) <P> In 1928 , when all U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . The obverse featured a cropped version of Thomas Jefferson 's portrait that had been on previous $2 bills . The reverse featured Jefferson 's home , Monticello . The note 's seal and serial numbers were red . The Series of 1928 $2 bill featured the treasury seal superimposed by the United States Note obligation to the left and a large gray TWO to the right . </P> <P> In 1953 the $2 bill received minor design changes analogous to the $5 United States Note . The treasury seal was made smaller and moved to the right side of the bill ; it was superimposed over the gray word TWO . The United States Note obligation now became superimposed over a gray numeral 2 . The reverse remained unchanged . </P> <P> The final change to $2 United States Notes came in 1963 when the motto IN GOD WE TRUST was added to the reverse over the Monticello . And , because dollar bills were soon to no longer be redeemable in silver , WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND was removed from the obverse . Two - dollar bills , along with $5 and $100 United States Notes , were officially discontinued in August 1966 , although they remain legal tender . </P> 1976 -- present ( edit ) Series 1976 first day of issue $2 bill with a canceled JFK postage stamp . <P> On April 13 , 1976 , the Treasury Department reintroduced the $2 bill as a cost - saving measure . Series 1976 $2 bills were redesigned and issued as a Federal Reserve Note . The obverse design remains basically unchanged since 1928 and features the same portrait of Jefferson . A green treasury seal and serial numbers replace the red used on the previous United States Notes . Since the reissue of the bill coincided with the United States Bicentennial , it was decided to use a bicentennial themed design on the reverse . An engraved rendition ( not an exact reproduction ) of John Trumbull 's The Declaration of Independence replaced Monticello on the reverse . First day issues of the new $2 bills could be taken to a post office and stamped with the date `` APR 13 1976 '' . In all , 590,720,000 notes from Series 1976 were printed . </P> <P> Currently , stamped series 1976 $2 bills typically trade for about twice their face value . If the bills were stamped in an exotic place , the value may be slightly higher . However , no first - day - issued 1976 $2 bills with stamps are especially rare or valuable . </P> <P> Despite their age , crisp , uncirculated series 1976 $2 bills are not uncommon and are not particularly valuable . These notes were saved and hoarded upon their original issue and are plentiful today . A typical single uncirculated 1976 $2 bill is worth only slightly above face value . If the note is circulated , then it is only worth its $2 face value . </P> <P> In 1996 and 1997 , 153,600,000 bills were printed as Series 1995 for the Federal Reserve District of Atlanta . In 2004 , 121,600,000 of the Series 2003 bills were printed for the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank . An issue of Series 2003A $2 bills was printed from July to September 2006 for all twelve Federal Reserve Banks . In all , 220,800,000 notes were printed . </P> <P> In February 2012 , the B.E.P. printed 512,000 Series 2009 $2 Star Notes , in anticipation of more regular runs being printed later in 2012 . Series 2009 $2 bills were issued to banks during the summer of 2012 . </P> <P> In November 2013 , the B.E.P. began printing series 2013 $2 bills for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ; these notes entered circulation in early 2014 . A total of 44,800,000 notes were ordered for fiscal year 2014 , which ran from October 2013 through September 2014 . </P> <H3> Series dates ( edit ) </H3> Large size ( edit ) Series 1880 $2 Legal Tender note showing a large brown treasury seal .

Because $2 bills are uncommon in daily use , their use can make a particular group of spenders visible . A documented case of using two - dollar bills to send a message to a community is the case of Geneva Steel and the communities in surrounding Utah County . In 1989 , Geneva Steel paid its employee bonuses in $2 bills . When the bills began to appear in different places , people recognized the importance of the company to the local economy . </P> <P> Use of the two - dollar bill is also being suggested by some gun rights activists to show support for Second Amendment rights , particularly at stores that allow Open Carry or Concealed carry of weapons on their premises . Two - dollar notes have also seen increased usage in situations where tipping is encouraged , especially in strip clubs . This is due to the idea that tips will increase because of the ease of use of a single , higher - denomination bill as the lowest common note in use . </P> <P> The use of the two - dollar bill is popular among fans and alumni of Clemson University who often bring notes with them when traveling to university athletic events in other localities as a demonstration of their economic impact in an area . The idea was first popularized in 1977 when Georgia Tech had threatened to no longer play the Tigers in football and has since caught on as a token of fandom when traveling to other locations . Fans will often stamp an orange tiger paw ( Clemson 's logo ) on the note as a sign of its origin . </P> <P> During the 1930s , the $2 bill was often used at East Coast horse race tracks to make a bet . Because of the German and Jewish influence , the bill was locally known in parts of New Jersey as a `` zwei - buck '' , and the upper right corner `` 2 '' was sometimes torn off to increase the luck . </P> <H3> Lockheed U-2 ( edit ) </H3> <P> `` U.S. Air Force pilots who fly the venerable Lockheed U-2 spy plane always keep a $2 bill in their flight suit . Each pilot is issued a number identifying their chronological position among the 1,000 or so pilots who have flown the U-2 solo . Some pilots search until they find a $2 bill with a serial number whose final digits match their pilot number . New pilots must provide $222 in $2 bills to fund the U-2 clubhouse at Beale Air Force Base , near Yuba City , California . Veteran pilots conduct periodic `` conformity checks '' to make sure new fliers are carrying at least one bill . The fine for a violation ? $2 . '' </P> <H3> Incidents ( edit ) </H3> <P> The relative scarcity of the $2 bill in everyday circulation has led to confusion at points of sale , as well as overreaction and prosecution of the individual attempting to tender the bill . </P> <P> In 2005 , a man in Baltimore , Maryland was jailed for attempting to use legally circulating $2 bills to pay a car stereo installation fee that Best Buy originally agreed to waive in the first place . </P> <P> In 2016 , a 13 - year - old girl in Texas was detained by police at Fort Bend Independent School District 's Christa McAuliffe Middle School , and prevented from eating lunch that day , for attempting to use a $2 bill to pay for chicken nuggets in the school cafeteria . </P> <H2> Uncut currency sheets ( edit ) </H2> Uncut 32 - subject sheet of series 1995 $2 Federal Reserve Notes . <P> Uncut currency sheets are available from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing . Some of the recent $2 uncut sheets from Series 1995 and Series 2003 have been collectibles as they come from special non-circulation printings . Most of the Series 1995 $2 uncut sheets had a higher suffix letter in the serial number than regular circulation $2 bills . Uncut $2 sheets from Series 2003 were printed for the Boston ( A ) , New York ( B ) , Atlanta ( F ) , Chicago ( G ) , Minneapolis ( I ) , and Dallas ( K ) Federal Reserve Districts despite the fact that notes from the Minneapolis district were the only ones released for circulation . Uncut sheets of Series 2003A have also been produced , although in this case circulating currency for all districts has also been made . All two - dollar bills beginning with Series 1995 have been printed in the BEP facility in Fort Worth , Texas ( indicated by `` FW '' preceding the face plate number on the obverse of the note ) . </P> <P> Uncut sheets of $2 bills are available in various sizes . A 32 - subject sheet , which is the original - size sheet on which the notes are printed , is available . Other sheet sizes available have been cut from the original 32 - subject sheet . These include half ( 16 - note ) , quarter ( 8 - note ) , and eighth ( 4 - note ) sheets for $2 bills . Uncut sheets are sold for more than their respective face values . Uncut sheets of large size notes ( issued before 1928 ) also exist , but are extremely rare . </P> <P> Steve Wozniak , a co-founder of Apple Inc. , has been using $2 banknotes separated from 4 - bill uncut sheets ( glued together into pads ) , to surprise merchants and waiters ; also , because of notes ' unusual appearance , he has been interviewed by a Secret Service agent . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ U.S. Currency Education Program . `` Weight of a US Banknote '' . uscurrency.gov .

White . The film , like the book , is about a pig named Wilbur who befriends an intelligent spider named Charlotte who saves him from being slaughtered . Released to theaters by Paramount Pictures , Charlotte 's Web features a song score of music and lyrics written by the Sherman Brothers , who had previously written music for family films like Mary Poppins ( 1964 ) , The Jungle Book ( 1967 ) , and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ( 1968 ) . It is the first of only three Hanna - Barbera features not to be based upon one of their famous television cartoons , Heidi 's Song ( 1982 ) and Once Upon a Forest ( 1993 ) being the other two . </P> <P> Charlotte 's Web was recorded in 1972 and released on February 22 , 1973 , to moderate critical and commercial success . The film has developed a devoted following over the following years due to television and VHS ; in 1994 it surprised the marketplace by becoming one of the best - selling titles of the year , 21 years after its first premiere . No other non-Disney musical animated film has enjoyed such a comeback in popularity , prompting a direct - to - video sequel , Charlotte 's Web 2 : Wilbur 's Great Adventure , which Paramount released in the US on March 18 , 2003 ( Universal released it internationally ) , followed by a live - action film version of the original story , which was released on December 15 , 2006 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Voice cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production </Li> <Li> 4 Release <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Home media </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Reception <Ul> <Li> 5.1 E.B.

Deciding to let Fern deal with nurturing the piglet , John allows Fern to raise it as a pet . She nurtures it lovingly , naming it Wilbur . Six weeks later , Wilbur , due to being a spring pig , has matured , and John tells Fern that Wilbur has to be sold ( his siblings were already sold ) . Fern sadly says good - bye to Wilbur as he is sold down the street to her uncle , Homer Zuckerman . At Homer 's farm , a goose coaxes a sullen Wilbur to speak his first words . Although delighted at this new ability , Wilbur still yearns for companionship . He attempts to get the goose to play with him , but she declines on the condition that she has to hatch her eggs . Wilbur also tries asking a rat named Templeton to play with him , but Templeton 's only interests are spying , hiding , and eating . Wilbur then wants to play with a lamb , but the lamb 's father says sheep do not play with pigs because it is only a matter of time before they are slaughtered and turned into smoked bacon and ham . Horrified at this depressing discovery , Wilbur reduces himself to tears until a mysterious voice tells him to `` chin up '' , and wait until morning to reveal herself to him . The following morning , she reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte A. Cavatica , living on a web on a corner of Homer 's barn overlooking Wilbur 's pig pen . She tells him that she will come up with a plan guaranteed to spare his life . </P> <P> Later , the goose 's goslings hatch . One of them , named Jeffrey , befriends Wilbur . Eventually , Charlotte reveals her plan to `` play a trick on Zuckerman '' , and consoles Wilbur to sleep . The next morning , Homer 's farmhand , Lurvy , sees the words , SOME PIG , spun within Charlotte 's web . The incident attracts publicity among Homer 's neighbors who deem the praise to be a miracle . The publicity eventually dies down , and Charlotte requests the barn animals to devise a new word to spin within her web . After several suggestions , the goose suggests the phrase , TERRIFIC ! TERRIFIC ! TERRIFIC ! , though Charlotte decides to shorten it to one TERRIFIC . The incident becomes another media sensation , though Homer still desires to slaughter Wilbur . For the next message , Charlotte then employs Templeton to pull a word from a magazine clipping at the dump for inspiration , in which he returns the word RADIANT ripped from a soap box to spin within her web . Following this , Homer decides to enter Wilbur in the county fair for the summer . Charlotte reluctantly decides to accompany him , though Templeton at first has no interest in doing so until the goose tells him about all the food there . After one night there , Charlotte sends Templeton to the trash pile on another errand to gather another word for her next message , in which he returns with the word , HUMBLE . The next morning , Wilbur awakens to find Charlotte has spun an egg sac containing her unborn offspring , and the following afternoon , the word , HUMBLE , is spun . However , Fern 's brother , Avery , discovers another pig named Uncle has won first place , though the county fair staff decides to hold a celebration in honor of Homer 's miraculous pig , and rewards him $ 25 and a gold medal . He then announces that he will allow Wilbur to `` live to a ripe old age '' . </P> <P> Exhausted from laying eggs and writing words , Charlotte tells Wilbur she will remain at the fair to die . Not willing to let her children be abandoned , Wilbur has Templeton retrieve her egg sac to take back to the farm , just before she dies . Once he returns to Homer 's farm , he guards the egg sac until the winter . The next spring , Charlotte 's 514 children are hatched , but leave the farm , causing Wilbur to become saddened to the point of wanting to run away . Just as he is about to do so , the ram points out that three of them did not fly away . Pleased at finding new friends , he names them Joy , Nellie , and Aranea , but as much as he loves them , they will never replace the memory of Charlotte . </P> <H2> Voice cast </H2> <Ul> <Li> Henry Gibson as Wilbur , a pig who was almost killed due to being a runt . Over time , however , he grows so much that one would never have known he was once a runt . When he learns of his fate of being slaughtered , Wilbur instantly breaks down into tears , until Charlotte tells him that she will do whatever it takes to save him . Wilbur is a friendly pig , but also prone to anxiety . </Li> <Li> Debbie Reynolds as Charlotte A. Cavatica , a spider who lives on a web in a corner of Homer 's barn above Wilbur 's pig pen .

He initially lives , eats , and sleeps with Wilbur rather than his mother and siblings . At one point , Avery remarks that he sounds more like a pig than a gosling , which pleases Jeffrey . When Wilbur is loaded into a crate destined for the fair , Jeffrey casually walks in to join him , amusing the humans but they still remove and restrain him nevertheless . International VHS releases show a deleted scene in which Jeffrey is briefly seen riding with Avery in the back of the Arables ' truck , until it stops so Avery can put him down in the middle of the road . Distressed at being separated from Wilbur , Jeffrey tries to catch up with the truck to no avail , leaving him heartbroken . His mother gently directs him to the pond to join his siblings . Despite his previous insistence that they be friends forever , Jeffrey does not reunite with Wilbur when the latter returns from the fair nor does he appear in the rest of the film . </Li> <Li> Herb Vigran as Lurvy , Homer 's farmhand who is the first to notice the messages in Charlotte 's webs . </Li> <Li> Pamelyn Ferdin as Fern Arable , John 's daughter who convinces him to spare Wilbur 's life . </Li> <Li> Martha Scott as Mrs. Arable , Fern 's mother who first tells her of what was going to happen to Wilbur . </Li> <Li> Bob Holt as Homer Zuckerman , Mrs. Arable 's brother and Fern 's uncle . </Li> <Li> John Stephenson as John Arable , Fern 's father .

It made its DVD debut in 2001 . A second DVD release of the film was released in 2006 . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> <P> Charlotte 's Web received generally positive reviews . Review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes reported that it has a 76 % approval rating based on 21 reviews , with an average score of 6.6 / 10 . Craig Butler of All - Movie Guide criticized the animation and the musical score , but called it a faithful adaptation , noting that `` no attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the story 's core '' . Dan Jardine criticized the songs and the `` Saturday morning cartoon quality '' of the animation , but also says that Hamner `` retains just enough of White 's elegant prose in the dialogue and narration to keep the film from being simply a painfully well - intended experiment . '' Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com stated that the animation is sometimes `` downright bad '' , but that White 's classic fable needs little to make it come to life . TV Guide reviewed the film with generally positive remarks , stating that `` The voices of Reynolds , Lynde , Gibson , and all the rest are perfectly cast , and the songs by the Sherman brothers are solid , although none of them became hits like those they wrote for such Disney movies as MARY POPPINS . '' When it was reissued on DVD it was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award . </P> <P> The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists : </P> <Ul> <Li> 2008 : AFI 's 10 Top 10 : <Ul> <Li> Nominated Animation Film </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H3> E.B. White 's reaction </H3> <P> According to Gene Deitch , White wrote the following words in a 1977 letter , `` We have never ceased to regret that your version of ' Charlotte 's Web ' never got made . The Hanna - Barbera version has never pleased either of us ... a travesty ... '' White himself wrote of the film , `` The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song . I do n't care much for jolly songs . The Blue Hill Fair , which I tried to report faithfully in the book , has become a Disney World , with 76 trombones . But that 's what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood . '' White had previously turned down Disney when they offered to make a film based on his book . According to the film 's writer , Earl Hamner Jr. , White -- who sometimes offered advice and suggestions to the filmmakers -- would have preferred the music of Mozart in the film , rather than the music of the Sherman Brothers . </P> <H2> Sequel </H2> Main article : Charlotte 's Web 2 : Wilbur 's Great Adventure <P> A direct - to - video sequel titled Charlotte 's Web 2 : Wilbur 's Great Adventure was released in 2003 . The sequel centers on Wilbur 's relationship with a lonely lamb named Cardigan and also shows Charlotte 's children as adolescents .

In `` Kaa 's Hunting '' , Bagheera and Baloo enlist Kaa 's help to rescue Mowgli when the man - cub is kidnapped by Bandar - log ( monkeys ) and taken to an abandoned human city called the Cold Lairs . Kaa breaks down the wall of the building in which Mowgli is imprisoned in and uses his serpentine hypnosis to draw the monkeys toward his waiting jaws . Bagheera and Baloo are also hypnotized , but Mowgli is immune because he is human and breaks the spell on his friends . </P> <P> In The Second Jungle Book , Kaa appears in the first half of the story `` The King 's Ankus '' . After Kaa and Mowgli spend some time relaxing , bathing and wrestling , Kaa persuades Mowgli to visit a treasure chamber guarded by an old cobra beneath the same Cold Lairs . The cobra tries to kill Mowgli but its poison has dried up . Mowgli takes a jeweled item away as a souvenir , not realizing the trouble it will cause them , and Kaa departs . </P> <P> In `` Red Dog '' , Mowgli asks Kaa for help when his wolf pack is threatened by rampaging dholes ( the red dogs of the title ) . Kaa goes into a trance so that he can search his century - long memory for a stratagem to defeat the dogs : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> For a long hour Mowgli lay back among the coils , while Kaa , his head motionless on the ground , thought of all that he had seen and known since the day he came from the egg . <P> The light seemed to go out of his eyes and leave them like stale opals , and now and again he made little stiff passes with his head , right and left , as though he were hunting in his sleep . Mowgli dozed quietly , for he knew that there is nothing like sleep before hunting , and he was trained to take it at any hour of the day or night . Then he felt Kaa 's back grow bigger and broader below him as the huge python puffed himself out , hissing with the noise of a sword drawn from a steel scabbard ; </P> <P> `` I have seen all the dead seasons , '' Kaa said at last , `` and the great trees and the old elephants , and the rocks that were bare and sharp - pointed ere the moss grew . Art thou still alive , Manling ? '' </P> </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> With Kaa 's help Mowgli tricks the dholes into attacking prematurely . Kaa takes no part in the resulting battle ( obliquely citing his loyalty to the boy rather than to the wolves , who often caused Mowgli grief ) but Mowgli and the wolves finally kill all the dholes , though not without grievous losses . </P> <P> In `` The Spring Running '' , as the teenage Mowgli reluctantly prepares to leave the jungle for the last time , Kaa tells Mowgli that `` it is hard to cast the skin , '' but Mowgli knows he must cast the skin of his old life in order to grow a new one . Kaa , Baloo and Bagheera sing for Mowgli in `` The Outsong '' , a poem and the ending of `` The Spring Running '' . </P> <H2> Disney films ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Disney animated films ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1967 Disney film , Kaa is markedly different from the Kipling character . Rather than being a mentor , he appears as a minor antagonist who twice manages to trap Mowgli in his coils in an attempt to eat him . He does this through the use of hypnotic eyes as opposed to the original version , in which he uses a serpentine dance to control his prey . Both of his attempts to eat Mowgli end in comical failure because he is interrupted right before he can swallow him . Kaa is depicted as cowardly , attempting to curry favor with Shere Khan whenever he is around . </P> <P> Voice actor Sterling Holloway decided to give Kaa a lisp , a condition that composers the Sherman Brothers brought into the character 's song in The Jungle Book , `` Trust in Me '' . </P> <P> This particular version of Kaa drew inspiration from previous Disney characters that followed a similar trope , such as Tick - Tock the Crocodile from Peter Pan and the Wolf from The Sword in the Stone . Both are fixated on a specific character ( namely Captain Hook and Wart , respectively ) as food and comically attempt to eat them throughout the film , without success . </P> <P> In The Jungle Book 2 , Kaa - now voiced by Jim Cummings - reappears in a smaller role . He is first seen attempting to eat the man - cub as Baloo and Mowgli reprise `` The Bare Necessities '' , but is thwarted each time . He eventually gives up , swearing he will `` never again associate with man - cubs '' . Kaa then comes across Shanti , who is lost in the jungle in search for Mowgli . He successfully hypnotizes her and attempts to eat her , but is stopped by Ranjan . He is last seen being interrogated by Shere Khan about Mowgli 's whereabouts , lying to the tiger that the boy is heading for the swamp . </P> <H3> 1994 live - action film ( edit ) </H3> <P> A far more menacing incarnation of the character appeared in the 1994 live - action adaptation . He was brought to life using an actual anaconda , but the bulk of his appearances were made using a mixture of CGI and animatronics . In the film , Kaa seems to serve King Louie , killing any intruders to the city when Louie summons him . Kaa attacks Mowgli inside the monkey city by tackling him into the moat and attempting to drown him , but Mowgli wounds him with a bejewelled dagger , forcing the python to flee in a pool of his own blood . </P> <P> By the time Mowgli returns to the city with Captain William Boone ( the main villain of the film ) and Kitty , Kaa has fully healed from their prior confrontation . After defeating Boone , Mowgli flees with Kitty when he hears King Louie summoning the python . Boone starts gathering as much treasure as he can , but notices that the monkeys have gone silent ; Kaa suddenly appears , then scares the injured Boone into the moat , where the heavy load of treasure he is carrying weighs him straight to the bottom . Desperately trying to struggle free , Boone sees the skeletal remains of Kaa 's past victims just seconds before the villain finally meets his death by the python . </P> <H3> 2016 live - action film ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kaa appeared in Walt Disney Pictures ' live - action adaptation of the animated film , directed by Jon Favreau . This version of Kaa is female and is voiced by Scarlett Johansson . This film 's Kaa ( like the previous Disney incarnations voiced by Sterling Holloway , Hal Smith , and Jim Cummings ) desires to eat Mowgli . Luring him in by promising to keep him safe , she hypnotizes him and reveals that the boy came to live in the jungle when Shere Khan killed his father as they were travelling between villages and Bagheera found him . She also reveals to him the power of the `` Red Flower '' ( fire ) and its dangers in her vision . During her storytelling , she attempts to devour him , but Baloo spots and rescues Mowgli , denying her of her meal . She is not seen again for the rest of the film , though during the end credits , she is heard singing `` Trust in Me '' . </P> <P> In an interview , Johansson elaborated on Kaa , saying that she uses both her voice and hypnotic gaze to entrance Mowgli so that he can not resist her embrace . She also says Kaa uses her story - telling to seduce and entrap Mowgli and describes Kaa as a `` window into Mowgli 's past '' . She notes that the way Kaa moves is `` very alluring '' , describing it as `` almost coquettish '' . Johansson also sings the song `` Trust in Me '' in the film ; she described her thoughts on the song : `` It 's a strange melody . We wanted it to be a lullaby , but it has a very mysterious sound . '' </P> <H2> Other appearances ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> In the 1967 Adventures of Mowgli Soviet cartoons , Kaa was voiced by Vladimir Ushakov . This version of the serpent , like the cartoons in general , is faithful to the original books . </Li> <Li> In the 1989 Japanese anime series Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli , Kaa 's personality is closer to the books than the Disney series . </Li> <Li> Kaa appeared in the short - lived 1996 animated TV series Jungle Cubs , this time seen as a friend of the other animals when they were cubs . He was voiced by Jim Cummings , who reprised this role in episodes of the animated television series Disney 's House of Mouse , the 2002 direct - to - video animated film Mickey 's House of Villains , and The Jungle Book 2 . </Li> <Li> Kaa also made an appearance as the snake charmer Karait 's pet python in the 1997 live - action film The Second Jungle Book : Mowgli & Baloo . </Li> <Li> Ubisoft and Disney Interactive Studios released the 2000 video game The Jungle Book Groove Party for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 video game consoles . The game featured Kaa as a character and also featured Kaa singing `` A Mood for Food '' . </Li> <Li> In the 2010 cgi animated television series , Kaa is given a more ferocious personality than in the books , but at the same time he is friends and allies with Mowgli , Bagheera , and Baloo . </Li> <Li> A mentor - like and heroic version will be voiced by Cate Blanchett in the upcoming live - action film , Mowgli , directed by Andy Serkis . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Sherman , Robert B .

      "question": "who said everyone will be famous for 15 minutes",
      "context": "15 minutes of fame - wikipedia <H1> 15 minutes of fame </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> 15 minutes of fame is short - lived media publicity or celebrity of an individual or phenomenon . The expression was inspired by Andy Warhol 's words `` In the future , everyone will be world - famous for 15 minutes '' , which appeared in the program for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm , Sweden . Photographer Nat Finkelstein claims credit for the expression , stating that he was photographing Warhol in 1966 for a proposed book . A crowd gathered trying to get into the pictures and Warhol supposedly remarked that everyone wants to be famous , to which Finkelstein replied , `` Yeah , for about fifteen minutes , Andy . '' The phenomenon is often used in reference to figures in the entertainment industry or other areas of popular culture , such as reality television and YouTube . </P> <P> An older version of the same concept in English is the expression `` nine days ' wonder '' , which dates at least as far back as the Elizabethan era . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Interpretation </Li> <Li> 2 Derivative phrases </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Interpretation ( edit ) </H2> <P> German art historian Benjamin H.D. Buchloh suggests that the core tenet of Warhol 's aesthetic , being `` the systematic invalidation of the hierarchies of representational functions and techniques '' of art , corresponds directly to the belief that the `` hierarchy of subjects worthy to be represented will someday be abolished , '' hence anybody , and therefore `` everybody , '' can be famous once that hierarchy dissipates , `` in the future , '' and by logical extension of that , `` in the future , everybody will be famous , '' and not merely those individuals worthy of fame . </P> <P> On the other hand , wide proliferation of the adapted idiom `` my fifteen minutes '' and its entrance into common parlance have led to a slightly different application , having to do with both the ephemerality of fame in the information age and , more recently , the democratization of media outlets brought about by the advent of the internet . In this formulation , Warhol 's quote has been taken to mean : `` At the present , because there are so many channels by which an individual might attain fame , albeit not enduring fame , virtually anyone can become famous for a brief period of time . '' </P> <P> There is a third and even more remote interpretation of the term , as used by an individual who has been legitimately famous or skirted celebrity for a brief period of time , that period of time being his or her `` fifteen minutes . '' </P> <P> John Langer suggests that 15 minutes of fame is an enduring concept because it permits everyday activities to become `` great effects . '' Tabloid journalism and the paparazzi have accelerated this trend , turning what may have before been isolated coverage into continuing media coverage even after the initial reason for media interest has passed . </P> <H2> Derivative phrases ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the song `` I Ca n't Read '' , released by David Bowie 's Tin Machine in their 1989 debut album and re-released by Bowie in 1997 for the soundtrack of the movie The Ice Storm , the phrase is used in direct reference to Andy Warhol : `` Andy , where 's my 15 minutes ? '' The age of reality television has seen the comment wryly updated as : `` In the future , everyone will be obscure for 15 minutes . '' The British artist Banksy has made a sculpture of a TV that has , written on its screen , `` In the future , everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes , '' which was later used in the lyrics of Robbie Williams ' song `` The Actor '' from his 2006 album Rudebox . </P> <P> A more recent adaptation of Warhol 's quip , possibly prompted by the rise of online social networking , blogging , and internet celebrity , is the claim that `` In the future , everyone will be famous to fifteen people '' or , in some renditions , `` On the Web , everyone will be famous to fifteen people '' . This quote , though attributed to David Weinberger , was said to have originated with the Scottish artist Momus . </P> <P> The Marilyn Manson song `` I Do n't Like the Drugs ( But the Drugs Like Me ) '' , released on his 1998 album Mechanical Animals , alludes to the term in the line `` We 're rehabbed and we 're ready for our fifteen minutes of shame '' , as part of the song 's theme of unrepentant escapism through drugs . </P> <P> The group Queensrÿche uses the words `` I guess Warhol was n't wrong / Fame fifteen Minutes Long '' in their 1988 anti-hero telltale album Operation : Mindcrime song as a way of showing the deterioration of society to reach its aim . </P> <P> After experiencing a boom of recognition in the late 90s , the rock group Sugar Ray made an album entitled `` 14 : 59 '' , jesting that their 15 minutes of fame was almost over . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Andy Warhol 's Fifteen Minutes ( a television show hosted by Warhol ) </Li> <Li> Big in Japan ( phrase ) </Li> <Li> Fad </Li> <Li> Famous for being famous </Li> <Li> Internet meme </Li> <Li> It girl </Li> <Li> One - hit wonder </Li> <Li> Reality show </Li> <Li> World famous in New Zealand </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Guinn and Perry , p. 4 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Guinn and Perry , pp. 364 -- 65 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Buchloh , Benjamin H.D.

      "context": "Gothic art - wikipedia <H1> Gothic art </H1> Jump to : navigation , search The Western ( Royal ) Portal at Chartres Cathedral ( ca . 1145 ) - these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures and were a revolution in style and the model for a generation of sculptors . Later Gothic depiction of the Adoration of the Magi from Strasbourg Cathedral . Gothic sculpture , late 15th century , Amiens Cathedral . <P> Gothic art was a style of medieval art that developed in Northern France out of Romanesque art in the 12th century AD , led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture . It spread to all of Western Europe , and much of Southern and Central Europe , never quite effacing more classical styles in Italy . In the late 14th century , the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed , which continued to evolve until the late 15th century . In many areas , especially Germany , Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century , before being subsumed into Renaissance art . Primary media in the Gothic period included sculpture , panel painting , stained glass , fresco and illuminated manuscripts . The easily recognizable shifts in architecture from Romanesque to Gothic , and Gothic to Renaissance styles , are typically used to define the periods in art in all media , although in many ways figurative art developed at a different pace . </P> <P> The earliest Gothic art was monumental sculpture , on the walls of Cathedrals and abbeys . Christian art was often typological in nature ( see Medieval allegory ) , showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side . Saints ' lives were often depicted . Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother , cuddling her infant , swaying from her hip , and showing the refined manners of a well - born aristocratic courtly lady . </P> <P> Secular art came into its own during this period with the rise of cities , foundation of universities , increase in trade , the establishment of a money - based economy and the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronize the arts and commission works resulting in a proliferation of paintings and illuminated manuscripts . Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art . With the growth of cities , trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters ' guild -- as a result , because of better record keeping , more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous ; some artists were even so bold as to sign their names . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Origins </Li> <Li> 2 Etymology </Li> <Li> 3 Painting <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Frescoes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Stained glass </Li> <Li> 3.3 Manuscripts and printmaking </Li> <Li> 3.4 Altarpiece and panel painting </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Sculpture <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Monumental sculpture </Li> <Li> 4.2 Portable sculpture </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Origins ( edit ) </H2> 14th Century International Gothic Mary Magdalene in St. John Cathedral in Toruń . <P> Gothic art emerged in Île - de-France , France , in the early 12th century at the Abbey Church of St Denis built by Abbot Suger . The style rapidly spread beyond its origins in architecture to sculpture , both monumental and personal in size , textile art , and painting , which took a variety of forms , including fresco , stained glass , the illuminated manuscript , and panel painting . Monastic orders , especially the Cistercians and the Carthusians , were important builders who disseminated the style and developed distinctive variants of it across Europe . Regional variations of architecture remained important , even when , by the late 14th century , a coherent universal style known as International Gothic had evolved , which continued until the late 15th century , and beyond in many areas . </P> <P> Although there was far more secular Gothic art than is often thought today , as generally the survival rate of religious art has been better than for secular equivalents , a large proportion of the art produced in the period was religious , whether commissioned by the church or by the laity . Gothic art was often typological in nature , reflecting a belief that the events of the Old Testament pre-figured those of the New , and that this was indeed their main significance . Old and New Testament scenes were shown side by side in works like the Speculum Humanae Salvationis , and the decoration of churches . The Gothic period coincided with a great resurgence in Marian devotion , in which the visual arts played a major part . Images of the Virgin Mary developed from the Byzantine hieratic types , through the Coronation of the Virgin , to more human and initimate types , and cycles of the Life of the Virgin were very popular . Artists like Giotto , Fra Angelico and Pietro Lorenzetti in Italy , and Early Netherlandish painting , brought realism and a more natural humanity to art . Western artists , and their patrons , became much more confident in innovative iconography , and much more originality is seen , although copied formulae were still used by most artists . </P> <P> Iconography was affected by changes in theology , with depictions of the Assumption of Mary gaining ground on the older Death of the Virgin , and in devotional practices such as the Devotio Moderna , which produced new treatments of Christ in subjects such as the Man of Sorrows , Pensive Christ and Pietà , which emphasized his human suffering and vulnerability , in a parallel movement to that in depictions of the Virgin . Even in Last Judgements Christ was now usually shown exposing his chest to show the wounds of his Passion . Saints were shown more frequently , and altarpieces showed saints relevant to the particular church or donor in attendance on a Crucifixion or enthroned Virgin and Child , or occupying the central space themselves ( this usually for works designed for side - chapels ) . Over the period many ancient iconographical features that originated in New Testament apocrypha were gradually eliminated under clerical pressure , like the midwives at the Nativity , though others were too well - established , and considered harmless . </P> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The word `` Gothic '' for art was initially used as a synonym for `` Barbaric '' , and was therefore used pejoratively . Its critics saw this type of Medieval art as unrefined and too remote from the aesthetic proportions and shapes of Classical art . Renaissance authors believed that the Sack of Rome by the Gothic tribes in 410 had triggered the demise of the Classical world and all the values they held dear . In the 15th century , various Italian architects and writers complained that the new ' barbarian ' styles filtering down from north of the Alps posed a similar threat to the classical revival promoted by the early Renaissance . The `` Gothic '' qualifier for this art was first used in Raphael 's letter to Pope Leo X c. 1518 and was subsequently popularised by the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari , who used it as early as 1530 , calling Gothic art a `` monstrous and barbarous '' `` disorder '' . Raphael claimed that the pointed arches of northern architecture were an echo of the primitive huts the Germanic forest dwellers formed by bending trees together - a myth which would resurface much later in a more positive sense in the writings of the German Romantic movement . `` Gothic art '' was strongly criticized by French authors such as Boileau , La Bruyère , Rousseau , before becoming a recognized form of art , and the wording becoming fixed . Molière would famously comment on Gothic : </P> <P> The besotted taste of Gothic monuments , These odious monsters of ignorant centuries , Which the torrents of barbary spewed forth . </P> <P> In its beginning , Gothic art was initially called `` French work '' ( Opus Francigenum ) , thus attesting the priority of France in the creation of this style . </P> <H2> Painting ( edit ) </H2> Simone Martini ( 1285 -- 1344 ) . French late Gothic frescos . <P> Painting in a style that can be called Gothic did not appear until about 1200 , nearly 50 years after the origins of Gothic architecture and sculpture . The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and not at all a clear break , and Gothic ornamental detailing is often introduced before much change is seen in the style of figures or compositions themselves . Then figures become more animated in pose and facial expression , tend to be smaller in relation to the background of scenes , and are arranged more freely in the pictorial space , where there is room . This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200 , in Germany around 1220 and Italy around 1300 . Painting during the Gothic period was practiced in four primary media : frescos , panel paintings , manuscript illumination and stained glass . </P> <H3> Frescoes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions . An accident of survival has given Denmark and Sweden the largest groups of surviving church wall paintings in the Biblia pauperum style , usually extending up to recently constructed cross vaults . In both Denmark and Sweden , they were almost all covered with limewash after the Reformation which has preserved them , but some have also remained untouched since their creation . Among the finest examples from Denmark are those of the Elmelunde Master from the Danish island of Møn who decorated the churches of Fanefjord , Keldby and Elmelunde . Albertus Pictor is arguably the most well - known fresco artist from the period working in Sweden . Examples of Swedish churches with well - preserved frescos include Tensta , Gökhem and Anga churches . </P> <H3> Stained glass ( edit ) </H3> <P> In northern Europe , stained glass was an important and prestigious form of painting until the 15th century , when it became supplanted by panel painting . Gothic architecture greatly increased the amount of glass in large buildings , partly to allow for wide expanses of glass , as in rose windows . In the early part of the period mainly black paint and clear or brightly coloured glass was used , but in the early 14th century the use of compounds of silver , painted on glass which was then fired , allowed a number of variations of colour , centred on yellows , to be used with clear glass in a single piece . By the end of the period designs increasingly used large pieces of glass which were painted , with yellows as the dominant colours , and relatively few smaller pieces of glass in other colours . </P> <H3> Manuscripts and printmaking ( edit ) </H3> <P> Illuminated manuscripts represent the most complete record of Gothic painting , providing a record of styles in places where no monumental works have otherwise survived . The earliest full manuscripts with French Gothic illustrations date to the middle of the 13th century . Many such illuminated manuscripts were royal bibles , although psalters also included illustrations ; the Parisian Psalter of Saint Louis , dating from 1253 to 1270 , features 78 full - page illuminations in tempera paint and gold leaf . </P> Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux , by Jean Pucelle , Paris , 1320s . <P> During the late 13th century , scribes began to create prayer books for the laity , often known as books of hours due to their use at prescribed times of the day . The earliest known example seems to have written for an unknown laywoman living in a small village near Oxford in about 1240 . Nobility frequently purchased such texts , paying handsomely for decorative illustrations ; among the most well - known creators of these is Jean Pucelle , whose Hours of Jeanne d'Evreux was commissioned by King Charles IV as a gift for his queen , Jeanne d'Évreux . Elements of the French Gothic present in such works include the use of decorative page framing reminiscent of the architecture of the time with elongated and detailed figures . The use of spatial indicators such as building elements and natural features such as trees and clouds also denote the French Gothic style of illumination . </P> <P> From the middle of the 14th century , blockbooks with both text and images cut as woodcut seem to have been affordable by parish priests in the Low Countries , where they were most popular . By the end of the century , printed books with illustrations , still mostly on religious subjects , were rapidly becoming accessible to the prosperous middle class , as were engravings of fairly high - quality by printmakers like Israhel van Meckenem and Master E.S. . In the 15th century , the introduction of cheap prints , mostly in woodcut , made it possible even for peasants to have devotional images at home . These images , tiny at the bottom of the market , often crudely coloured , were sold in thousands but are now extremely rare , most having been pasted to walls . </P> <H3> Altarpiece and panel painting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Painting with oil on canvas did not become popular until the 15th and 16th centuries and was a hallmark of Renaissance art . In Northern Europe the important and innovative school of Early Netherlandish painting is in an essentially Gothic style , but can also be regarded as part of the Northern Renaissance , as there was a long delay before the Italian revival of interest in classicism had a great impact in the north . Painters like Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck , made use of the technique of oil painting to create minutely detailed works , correct in perspective , where apparent realism was combined with richly complex symbolism arising precisely from the realistic detail they could now include , even in small works . In Early Netherlandish painting , from the richest cities of Northern Europe , a new minute realism in oil painting was combined with subtle and complex theological allusions , expressed precisely through the highly detailed settings of religious scenes . The Mérode Altarpiece ( 1420s ) of Robert Campin , and the Washington Van Eyck Annunciation or Madonna of Chancellor Rolin ( both 1430s , by Jan van Eyck ) are examples . For the wealthy , small panel paintings , even polyptychs in oil painting were becoming increasingly popular , often showing donor portraits alongside , though often much smaller than , the Virgin or saints depicted . These were usually displayed in the home . </P> <H2> Sculpture ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Monumental sculpture ( edit ) </H3> French ivory Virgin and Child , end of the 13th century , 25 cm high , curving to fit the shape of the ivory tusk . <P> The Gothic period is essentially defined by Gothic architecture , and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish . The facades of large churches , especially around doors , continued to have large tympanums , but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them . </P> <P> The statues on the Western ( Royal ) Portal at Chartres Cathedral ( c. 1145 ) show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation , but those on the south transept portal , from 1215 -- 20 , show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind , and some awareness of the classical tradition . These trends were continued in the west portal at Rheims Cathedral of a few years later , where the figures are almost in the round , as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe . Bamberg Cathedral has perhaps the largest assemblage of 13th century sculpture , culminating in 1240 with the Bamberg Rider , the first life - size equestrian statue in Western art since the 6th century . </P> <P> In Italy Nicola Pisano ( 1258 -- 78 ) and his son Giovanni developed a style that is often called Proto - Renaissance , with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions , including a sympathetic handling of nudity , in relief panels on their pulpit of Siena Cathedral ( 1265 -- 68 ) , the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia , and Giovanni 's pulpit in Pistoia of 1301 . </P> <P> Another revival of classical style is seen in the International Gothic work of Claus Sluter and his followers in Burgundy and Flanders around 1400 . Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North , with a fashion for very large wooden sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures ; most surviving examples are in Germany , after much iconoclasm elsewhere . Tilman Riemenschneider , Veit Stoss and others continued the style well into the 16th century , gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences . </P> <P> Life - size tomb effigies in stone or alabaster became popular for the wealthy , and grand multi-level tombs evolved , with the Scaliger Tombs of Verona so large they had to be moved outside the church . By the 15th century there was an industry exporting Nottingham alabaster altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> South portal of Chartres Cathedral ( c. 1215 - 20 ) . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> West portal at Rheims Cathedral , Annunciation group . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Nicola Pisano , Nativity and Adoration of the Magi from the pulpit of the Pisa Baptistery . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Claus Sluter , David and a prophet from the Well of Moses . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Base of the Holy Thorn Reliquary , French ( Paris ) , 1390s , a Resurrection of the Dead in gold , enamel and gems . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Man of Sorrows on the main portal of Ulm Münster by Hans Multscher , 1429 . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Panelled altarpiece section with Resurrection of Christ , English Nottingham alabaster , 1450 -- 90 , with remains of colour . </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Detail of the Last Supper from Tilman Riemenschneider 's Altar of the Holy Blood , 1501 -- 05 , carved limewood , Rothenburg ob der Tauber , Bavaria . </P> </Li> </Ul> <H3> Portable sculpture ( edit ) </H3> Lid of the Walters Casket , with the Siege of the Castle of Love at left , and jousting . Paris , 1330 - 1350 . Image of Cristo de La Laguna ( Tenerife , Spain ) from Flanders and dated between 1510 - 1514 . <P> Small carvings , for a mainly lay and often female market , became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres . Types of ivories included small devotional polyptychs , single figures , especially of the Virgin , mirror - cases , combs , and elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances , used as engagement presents . The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate jewelled and enamelled metalwork , both secular and religious , like the Duc de Berry 's Holy Thorn Reliquary , until they ran short of money , when they were melted down again for cash . </P> <P> Gothic sculptures independent of architectural ornament were primarily created as devotional objects for the home or intended as donations for local churches. , although small reliefs in ivory , bone and wood cover both religious and secular subjects , and were for church and domestic use . Such sculptures were the work of urban artisans , and the most typical subject for three dimensional small staues is the Virgin Mary alone or with child . Paris was the main centre of ivory workshops , and exported to most of northern Europe , though Italy also had a considerable production . An exemplar of these independent sculptures is among the collections of the Abbey Church of St Denis ; the silver - gilt Virgin and Child dates to 1339 and features Mary enveloped in a flowing cloak holding an infantile Christ figure . Both the simplicity of the cloak and the youth of the child presage other sculptures found in northern Europe dating to the 14th century and early 15th century . Such sculpture shows an evolution from an earlier stiff and elongated style , still partly Romanesque , into a spatial and naturalistic feel in the late 12th and early 13th century . Other French Gothic sculptural subjects included figures and scenes from popular literature of the time . Imagery from the poetry of the troubadours was particularly popular among artisans of mirror - cases and small boxes presumably for use by women . The Casket with Scenes of Romances ( Walters 71264 ) of 1330 - 50 is an unusually large example with space for a number of scenes from different literary sources . </P> <P> Souvenirs of pilgrimages to shrines , such as clay or lead badges , medals and ampullae stamped with images were also popular and cheap . Their secular equivalent , the livery badge , were signs of feudal and political loyalty or alliance that came to be regarded as a social menace in England under bastard feudalism . The cheaper forms were sometimes given away free , as with the 13,000 badges ordered in 1483 by King Richard III of England in fustian cloth with his emblem of a white boar for the investiture of his son Edward as Prince of Wales , a huge number given the population at the time . The Dunstable Swan Jewel , modelled fully in the round in enamelled gold , is a far more exclusive version , that would have been given to someone very close or important to the donor . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Gothic art . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Gothic painters . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> List of Gothic artists </Li> <Li> Pleurants </Li> <Li> Renaissance of the 12th century </Li> <Li> Blackletter ( also known as Gothic script ) </Li> <Li> The Ten Virgins </Li> <Li> Danse Macabre </Li> <Li> History of Painting </Li> <Li> Western painting </Li> <Li> Church frescos in Denmark </Li> <Li> Church frescos in Sweden </Li> <Li> Timeline of Italian artists to 1800 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Stokstad ( 2005 ) , 516 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Stokstad ( 2005 ) , 544 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Émile Mâle , The Gothic Image , Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century , p 165 - 8 , English trans of 3rd edn , 1913 , Collins , London ( and many other editions ) is a classic work on French Gothic church art </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Gothic art '' .

Wellington Wimpy , generally referred to as Wimpy , is one of the characters in the long - running comic strip Popeye , created by E.C. Segar in 1934 and originally called Thimble Theatre , and in the Popeye cartoons based upon the strip . Wimpy was one of the dominant characters in the newspaper strip , but when Popeye was adapted as an animated cartoon series by Fleischer Studios , Wimpy became a minor character ; Dave Fleischer said that the character in the Segar strip was `` too intellectual '' to be used in film cartoons . Wimpy did appear in Robert Altman 's 1980 live - action musical film Popeye , played by veteran character actor Paul Dooley . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inspiration </Li> <Li> 2 Character </Li> <Li> 3 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Inspiration ( edit ) </H2> <P> The character seems to have been inspired by more than one person whom Segar had encountered . Wimpy 's personality was based upon that of William Schuchert , the manager of the Chester Opera House where Segar was first employed . `` Windy Bill , '' as he was known , was a pleasant , friendly man , fond of tall tales and hamburgers . </P> <P> Additional sources suggest that Segar composed the character 's name from the names of two other acquaintances . According to fellow cartoonist Bill Mauldin , the name was suggested by that of Wellington J. Reynolds , one of Segar 's instructors at the Chicago Art Institute . In a brief 1935 interview in The Daily Oklahoman , H. Hillard Wimpee of Atlanta indicated that he was connected to the character , having worked with Segar at the Chicago Herald - Examiner in 1917 . It became a custom in the office that whoever accepted an invitation for a hamburger would pay the bill . According to Wimpee , after seeing the character in the newspaper , he wrote Segar in 1922 about Wimpy , `` afraid of being connected with what ( Segar ) was doing with ( the character ) . '' He said Segar replied , `` ' You have n't seen anything yet . ' '' </P> <H2> Character ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wimpy is Popeye 's friend . In the cartoons , he mainly plays the role of the `` straight man '' to Popeye 's outbursts and wild antics . Wimpy is soft - spoken , very intelligent , and well educated , but also cowardly , very lazy , overly parsimonious and utterly gluttonous . He is also something of a scam artist and , especially in the newspaper strip , can be underhanded . </P> <P> Hamburgers are Wimpy 's all - time favorite food , and he is usually seen carrying or eating one or more at a time -- e.g. , in Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor he is seen grinding meat or eating burgers almost the entire time -- however , he is usually too cheap to pay for them himself . A recurring joke involves Wimpy 's attempts to con other patrons of the diner into buying his meal for him . His best - known catchphrase started in 1931 as , `` Cook me up a hamburger . I 'll pay you Thursday . '' In 1932 , this then became the famous , `` I 'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . '' The phrase was also slightly altered in the episode `` Spree Lunch '' to `` I 'll have a hamburger , for which I will gladly pay you Tuesday . '' This phrase is now commonly used to illustrate financial irresponsibility and still appears in modern comedies such as The Drew Carey Show and The Office . The initial part of the phrase was even the title of Episode 6 of the fourth season of Cheers `` I 'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday . '' </P> <P> In Robert Altman 's 1980 live - action musical film Popeye , where Wimpy was played by veteran character actor Paul Dooley , one of Harry Nilsson 's original songs , `` Everything Is Food , '' featured Dooley singing the catch - phrase , as he took a hamburger , as `` I would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . '' The response from the chorus , as they reclaimed the same hamburger from him , uneaten , was `` He would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . '' Later in the film , a sign in a restaurant reads `` Positively NO CREDIT . This means YOU , Wimpy . '' </P> <P> Wimpy had other frequently used lines in the original comic strip . On some occasions , Wimpy tries to placate someone by saying , `` I 'd like to invite you over to my house for a duck dinner . '' He then moves away quickly to a safe distance and yells , `` You bring the ducks ! '' Another such line was , `` Jones is my name ... I 'm one of the Jones boys '' -- an attempt to defuse a hostile situation with a mistaken identity . To deflect an enemy 's wrath , he would sometimes indicate a third party and say , `` Let 's you and him fight '' , starting a brawl from which he quickly withdrew . </P> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> During World War II , `` Wimpy '' , in reference to the character , was the nickname given to the Vickers Wellington bomber . </Li> <Li> Wimpy is also the namesake of the large chain of Wimpy hamburger restaurants which was founded in Bloomington , Indiana in the 1930s and opened in the UK in 1954 ; it has maintained operations overseas since 1967 . Their UK website states , `` The name Wimpy is believed to have come from Popeye 's friend J Wellington Wimpy who loved hamburgers as much as Popeye loved spinach . '' </Li> <Li> Wimpy can also be found as the mascot for `` Wimpy 's Seafood Restaurant and Market '' in Osterville , MA on Cape Cod . ( Established 1938 ) </Li> <Li> Wimpy made a cameo appearance ( as an in - gag to both his facial features ; in the context of beef related heart disease and affinity for hamburgers ) in the Family Guy episode `` McStroke '' . </Li> <Li> Wimpy has appeared in two episodes of the Adult Swim animated series Robot Chicken , often using his `` I 'll gladly pay you Tuesday '' line to buy hamburgers . Often it fails . Voiced by Scott Adsit . </Li> <Li> In the Good Eats second season episode `` Daily Grind '' ( aka `` A Grind is a Terrible Thing to Waste '' ) , Alton Brown prepares the `` perfect burger '' ( as well as meatloaf & meatballs ) for a character named `` J. Wellington Whimpy '' ( misspelled , but looking mostly like the version of Wimpy played by Paul Dooley in the Popeye film ) played by then cast regular Steve Rooney . </Li> <Li> In the final Pooch the Pup cartoon called She Done Him Right , a dog character looking like Wimpy is seen playing a slot machine . </Li> <Li> Wimpy 's famous catchphrase gives the name to the hamburger review website A Hamburger Today . </Li> <Li> Wimpy is also the focus of an animated Bank of America commercial in which he uses a new smartphone app to finally pay for the food he mooched from his friends . </Li> <Li> Season 4 Episode 6 of Cheers is named `` I 'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday '' . </Li> <Li> In the hit video game World of Warcraft , an NPC can be heard repeating `` I 'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today '' in the city of Stormwind . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Fictional characters portal </Li> <Li> United States portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Mr Micawber </Li> <Li> Harold Skimpole </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In Italian , Wimpy is known as `` Poldo Sbaffini '' ; his surname is a reference to his scrounging habits . The Italian name was also adopted in the Greek editions as Πόλντο . In Spanish , Wimpy is `` Pilón '' , Spanish for `` pestle '' , which may refer to the character 's body shape . In Sweden Wimpy is called Frasse and , unlike in the American version where he eats hamburgers , he instead eats parisare , a similar Swedish dish . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Fred Grandinetti , Popeye : an illustrated cultural history , pp. 5 -- 6 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Bill Mauldin , The Brass Ring , New York : W.W.

It replaced the earlier national arms , which had been in use since 1910 . The motto ǃke e : ǀxarra ǁke is written in the Khoisan language of the ǀXam people and translates literally to `` diverse people unite '' . The previous motto , in Latin , was Ex Unitate Vires , translated as `` From unity , strength '' . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Blazon </Li> <Li> 3 The oval shape of foundation </Li> <Li> 4 The oval shape of ascendance </Li> <Li> 5 1910 arms <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Evolution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The design process was initiated when , in 1999 , the Department of Arts , Culture , Science and Technology requested ideas for the new coat - of - arms from the public . A brief was then prepared based on the ideas received , along with input from the Cabinet . The Government Communication and Information System then approached Design South Africa to brief ten of the top designers . Three designers were chosen to present their concepts to the Cabinet . Iaan Bekker 's design was chosen . </P> <P> The new arms were introduced on Freedom Day , 27 April 2000 . The change reflected government 's aim to highlight the democratic change in South Africa and a new sense of patriotism . </P> <P> The coat of arms is a series of elements organised in distinct symmetric egg - like or oval shapes placed on top of one another . The completed structure of the coat of arms combines the lower and higher oval shape in a symbol of infinity . The path that connects the lower edge of the scroll , through the lines of the tusks , with the horizon above and the sun rising at the top , forms the shape of the cosmic egg from which the secretary bird rises . In the symbolic sense , this is the implied rebirth of the spirit of the great and heroic nation of South Africa . </P> <P> The coat of arms is also a central part of the Seal of the Republic , traditionally considered to be the highest emblem of the State . Absolute authority is given to every document with an impression of the Seal of the Republic on it , as this means that it has been approved by the President of South Africa . Since 1997 , however , the use of the Seal of the Republic has not actually been required by the Constitution , but it continues to be used . </P> <H2> Blazon ( edit ) </H2> <P> The official blazon of the arms is : </P> <P> Or , representations of two San human figures of red ochre , statant respectant , the hands of the innermost arms clasped , with upper arm , inner wrist , waist and knee bands Argent , and a narrow border of red ochre ; the shield ensigned of a spear and knobkierie in saltire , Sable . Thereabove a demi - secretary bird displayed Or , charged on the breast with a stylised representation of a protea flower with outer petals Vert , inner petals Or and seeded of nine triangles conjoined in three rows , the upper triangle Gules , the second row Vert , Or inverted and Vert , and the third row Vert , Or inverted , Sable , Or inverted and Vert . Above the head of the secretary bird an arc of seven rays facetted Or and Orange , the two outer rays conjoined to the elevated wings . </P> <P> Upon a riband Vert , the motto ! KE E : / XARRA / / KE in letters Argent . Issuant from the ends of the riband two pairs of elephant tusks curving inwards , the tips conjoined to the wings of the secretary bird , Or , therewithin and flanking the shields , two ears of wheat Brunatré . </P> <H2> The oval shape of foundation ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first element is the motto , in a green semicircle . Completing the semicircle are two symmetrically placed pairs of elephant tusks pointing upwards . Within the oval shape formed by the tusks are two symmetrical ears of wheat , that in turn frame a centrally placed gold shield . </P> <P> The shape of the shield makes reference to the drum , and contains two human figures from Khoisan rock art . The figures are depicted facing one another in greeting and in unity . </P> <P> Above the shield are a spear and a knobkierie , crossed in a single unit . These elements are arranged harmoniously to give focus to the shield and complete the lower oval shape of foundation . </P> <Ul> <Li> The motto </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The motto is : ! ke e : / xarra / / ke , written in the Khoisan language of the / Xam people , literally meaning `` diverse people unite '' . It addresses each individual effort to harness the unity between thought and action . On a collective scale it calls for the nation to unite in a common sense of belonging and national pride - unity in diversity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The ears of wheat </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> An emblem of fertility , it also symbolises the idea of germination , growth and the feasible development of any potential . It relates to the nourishment of the people and signifies : the agricultural aspects of the Earth . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Elephant tusks </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> Elephants symbolise wisdom , strength , moderation and eternity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The shield </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> It has a dual function as a vehicle for the display of identity and of spiritual defence . It contains the primary symbol of our nation . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The human figures </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The figures are depicted in an attitude of greeting , symbolising unity . This also represents the beginning of the individual 's transformation into the greater sense of : belonging to the nation and by extension , collective humanity . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The spear and knobkierie </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> A dual symbol of defence and authority , they in turn represent the powerful legs of the secretary bird . The spear and knobkierie are lying down , symbolising peace . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> The oval shape of ascendance ( edit ) </H2> <P> Immediately above the oval shape of foundation , is the visual centre of the coat of arms , a protea . The petals of the protea are rendered in a triangular pattern reminiscent of the crafts of Africa . </P> <P> The secretary bird is placed above the protea and the flower forms the chest of the bird . The secretary bird stands with its wings uplifted in a regal and uprising gesture . The distinctive head feathers of the secretary bird crown a strong and vigilant head . The rising sun above the horizon is placed between the wings of the secretary bird and completes the oval shape of ascendance . </P> <P> The combination of the upper and lower oval shapes intersect to form an unbroken infinite course , and the great harmony between the basic elements result in a dynamic , elegant and thoroughly distinctive design . Yet it clearly retains the stability , gravity and immediacy that a coat of arms demands . </P> <Ul> <Li> The King protea ' </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The protea is an emblem of the beauty of our land and the flowering of our potential as a nation in pursuit of the African Renaissance . The protea symbolises the holistic : integration of forces that grow from the Earth and are nurtured from above . The most popular colours of Africa have been assigned to the protea -- green , gold , red and black . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The secretary bird </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> The secretary bird is characterised in flight , the natural consequence of growth and speed . It is the equivalent of the lion on Earth . A powerful bird whose legs - depicted as the : spear and knobkierie - serve it well in its hunt for snakes , symbolising protection of the nation against its enemies . It is a messenger of the heavens and conducts its grace upon : the Earth . In this sense it is a symbol of divine majesty . Its uplifted wings are an emblem of the ascendance of our nation , while simultaneously offering us its protection . It is : depicted in gold , which clearly symbolises its association with the sun and the highest power . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The rising sun </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> An emblem of brightness , splendour and the supreme principle of the nature of energy . It symbolises the promise of rebirth , the active faculties of reflection , knowledge , good judgement and willpower . It is the symbol of the source of life , of light and the ultimate wholeness of humanity . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> 1910 arms ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first coat of arms was granted by King George V by Royal Warrant on 17 September 1910 . This was a few months after the formation of the Union of South Africa . </P> <P> It was a combination of symbols representing the four provinces ( formerly colonies ) that made up the Union . </P> <Ul> <Li> The first quarter is the figure of Hope , representing the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope . </Li> <Li> The two wildebeests of the second quarter represent the Colony of Natal . </Li> <Li> The orange tree in the third quarter was used as the symbol of the Orange Free State Republic . </Li> <Li> The wagon in the fourth quarter represented the Transvaal . </Li> <Li> The supporters are taken from the arms of the Orange River Colony and the Cape Colony . </Li> <Li> The lion holds four rods , bound together , symbolising the unification of the four former colonies . </Li> </Ul> <P> The motto , Ex Unitate Vires was officially translated as `` Union is Strength '' until 1961 , and thereafter as `` Unity is Strength '' . </P> <H3> Evolution ( edit ) </H3> <P> Three official renditions of the arms were used . The original rendition ( 1910 ) was the only version used until 1930 , and it continued to be used as the rank badge of warrant officers in the South African Defence Force and South African National Defence Force until 2002 . The second version , painted in 1930 and known as the `` ordinary coat of arms '' , and the third version , painted in 1932 and known as the `` embellished coat of arms '' , were both used until 2000 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1910 </Td> <Td> 1930 </Td> <Td> 1932 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> South Africa portal </Li> <Li> Heraldry portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> South African heraldry </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Orange Free State </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Cape Colony </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of Natal </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Transvaal </Li> <Li> Coat of arms of the Orange River Colony </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Brownell , F.G.

Its main role is to facilitate recycling of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the energy currency of the cell , primarily in muscle and brain tissue . This is achieved by recycling adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) to ATP via donation of phosphate groups . Creatine also acts as a pH buffer in tissues . </P> <P> Creatine synthesis primarily occurs in the liver and kidneys . On average , it is produced endogenously at an estimated rate of about 8.3 mmol or 1 gram per day in young adults . Creatine is also obtained through the diet at a rate of about 1 gram per day from an omnivorous diet . Most of the human body 's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are found in skeletal muscle , while the remainder is distributed in the blood , brain , and other tissues . </P> <P> Creatine was identified in 1832 when Michel Eugène Chevreul isolated it from the basified water - extract of skeletal muscle . He later named the crystallized precipitate after the Greek word for meat , κρέας ( kreas ) . In solution , creatine is in equilibrium with creatinine . Creatine is a derivative of the guanidinium cation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Biosynthesis </Li> <Li> 2 Phosphocreatine system </Li> <Li> 3 Health effects <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Supplements </Li> <Li> 3.2 Pharmacokinetics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Pregnancy and breastfeeding </Li> <Li> 3.4 Muscle disorders </Li> <Li> 3.5 Heterocyclic amines </Li> <Li> 3.6 Parkinson 's disease </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Biosynthesis ( edit ) </H2> <P> Creatine is not an essential nutrient as it is naturally produced in the human body from the amino acids glycine and arginine . In the first step of the biosynthesis these two amino acids are combined by the enzyme arginine : glycine amidinotransferase ( AGAT , EC : 2.1. 4.1 ) to form guanidinoacetate , which is then methylated by guanidinoacetate N - methyltransferase ( GAMT , EC : 2.1. 1.2 ) , using S - adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor . Creatine itself can be phosphorylated by creatine kinase to form phosphocreatine , which is used as an energy buffer in skeletal muscles and the brain . </P> <P> Synthesis primarily takes place in the kidney and liver , with creatine then being transported to the muscles via the blood . The majority of the human body 's total creatine and phosphocreatine stores are located in skeletal muscle , while the remainder is distributed in the blood , brain , and other tissues . On average , creatine is produced endogenously at an estimated rate of about 8.3 mmol or 1 gram per day in young adults . Creatine is also obtained through the diet at a rate of about 1 gram per day from an omnivorous diet . Some small studies suggest that total muscle creatine is significantly lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians , as expected since vegetables are not a primary source of creatine . However , subjects happened to show the same levels after using supplements . Given that creatine can be synthesized from the above - mentioned amino acids , protein sources rich in these amino acids can be expected to provide sufficient native biosynthesis in the body . </P> <P> Genetic deficiencies in the creatine biosynthetic pathway lead to various severe neurological defects . Clinically , there are three distinct disorders of creatine metabolism . Deficiencies in the two synthesis enzymes can cause L - arginine : glycine amidinotransferase deficiency and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency . Both biosynthetic defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner . A third defect , creatine transporter defect is caused by mutations in SLC6A8 and inherited in a X-linked manner . This condition is related to the transport of creatine into the brain . </P> <H2> Phosphocreatine system ( edit ) </H2> <P> Creatine , which is synthesized in the liver and kidneys , is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands , such as the brain and skeletal muscle , through an active transport system . The concentration of ATP in skeletal muscle is usually 2 -- 5 mM , which would result in a muscle contraction of only a few seconds . Fortunately , during times of increased energy demands , the phosphagen ( or ATP / PCr ) system rapidly resynthesizes ATP from ADP with the use of phosphocreatine ( PCr ) through a reversible reaction with the enzyme creatine kinase ( CK ) . In skeletal muscle , PCr concentrations may reach 20 -- 35 mM or more . Additionally , in most muscles , the ATP regeneration capacity of CK is very high and is therefore not a limiting factor . Although the cellular concentrations of ATP are small , changes are difficult to detect because ATP is continuously and efficiently replenished from the large pools of PCr and CK . Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of PCr , potentially increasing the muscle 's ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increased energy demands . </P> The pathway for the synthesis of creatine Arg -- Arginine ; GATM -- Glycine amidinotransferase ; GAMT -- Guanidinoacetate N - methyltransferase ; Gly -- Glycine ; Met -- Methionine ; SAH -- S - adenosyl homocysteine ; SAM -- S - adenosyl methionine . The color scheme is as follows : enzymes , coenzymes and the Met part , substrate names , the Gly part , the Arg part <H2> Health effects ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Supplements ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Creatine supplements <P> Creatine supplements are used by athletes , bodybuilders , wrestlers , sprinters , and others who wish to gain muscle mass . The Mayo Clinic states that creatine has been associated with asthmatic symptoms . </P> <P> A 2009 systematic review discredited concerns that creatine supplementation could affect hydration status and heat tolerance and lead to muscle cramping and diarrhea . </P> <P> There are reports of kidney damage with creatine use , such as interstitial nephritis ; patients with kidney disease should avoid use of this supplement . In similar manner , liver function may be altered , and caution is advised in those with underlying liver disease , although studies have shown little or no adverse impact on kidney or liver function from oral creatine supplementation . In 2004 the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) published a record which stated that oral long - term intake of 3 g pure creatine per day is risk - free . A 2003 study on athletes who took creatine for 21 months found no significant changes in markers of kidney function ; a 2008 study on athletes who took creatine for 3 months found no evidence of kidney damage during that time . A review found creatine to have no effects on liver or kidney function in over months of supplementation in both young and old population . However authors still cautioned against using high doses ( > 3g - 5g ) in those with impaired kidney functioning , and suggested further studies are needed relating to claims of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity . </P> <P> Long - term administration of large quantities of creatine is reported to increase the production of formaldehyde , which has the potential to cause serious unwanted side effects . However , this risk is largely theoretical because urinary excretion of formaldehyde , even under heavy creatine supplementation , does not exceed normal limits . </P> <P> Extensive research has shown that oral creatine supplementation at a rate of five to 20 grams per day appears to be very safe and largely devoid of adverse side - effects , while at the same time effectively improving the physiological response to resistance exercise , increasing the maximal force production of muscles in both men and women . </P> <P> Many meta analyses found that creatine treatment resulted in no abnormal kidney , liver , heart , or muscle function . It is ineffective as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . </P> <P> While some research indicates that supplementation with pure creatine is safe , a 2011 survey of 33 supplements commercially available in Italy found that over 50 % of them exceeded the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in at least one contaminant . The most prevalent of these contaminants was creatinine , a breakdown product of creatine also produced by the body . Creatinine was present in higher concentrations than the European Food Safety Authority recommendations in 44 % of the samples . About 15 % of the samples had detectable levels of dihydro - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazine or a high dicyandiamide concentration . Heavy metals contamination was not found to be a concern , with only minor levels of mercury being detectable . Two studies reviewed in 2007 found no impurities . </P> <H3> Pharmacokinetics ( edit ) </H3> This graph shows the mean plasma creatine concentration ( measured in μmol / L ) over an 8 - hour period following ingestion of 4.4 grams of creatine in the form of creatine monohydrate ( CrM ) , tri-creatine citrate ( CrC ) , or creatine pyruvate ( CrPyr ) . <P> Endogenous serum or plasma creatine concentrations in healthy adults are normally in a range of 2 -- 12 mg / L. A single 5 g ( 5000 mg ) oral dose in healthy adults results in a peak plasma creatine level of approximately 120 mg / L at 1 -- 2 hours post-ingestion . Creatine has a fairly short elimination half - life , averaging just less than 3 hours , so to maintain an elevated plasma level it would be necessary to take small oral doses every 3 -- 6 hours throughout the day . After the `` loading dose '' period ( 1 -- 2 weeks , 12 -- 24 ga day ) , it is no longer necessary to maintain a consistently high serum level of creatine . As with most supplements , each person has their own genetic `` preset '' amount of creatine they can hold . The rest is eliminated as waste . A typical post-loading dose is 2 -- 5 g daily . </P> <H3> Pregnancy and breastfeeding ( edit ) </H3> <P> While research is limited , some recent retrospective studies show higher maternal serum creatine to correlate with higher birth weight and better birth outcomes . However , as of 2014 , there were no randomised controlled trials establishing its effectiveness when supplemented , for neuroprotection of the fetus . </P> <P> Pasteurized cow 's milk contains higher levels of creatine than human milk . </P> <H3> Muscle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> A meta analysis found that creatine treatment increased muscle strength in muscular dystrophies , and potentially improved functional performance . Creatine treatment does not appear to improve muscle strength in people who have metabolic myopathies . High doses of creatine leads to increased muscle pain and an impairment in activities of daily living when taken by people who have McArdle disease . It has also been implicated in decreasing mutagenesis in DNA . </P> <H3> Heterocyclic amines ( edit ) </H3> <P> When creatine is mixed with protein and sugar at high temperatures ( above 148 ° C ) , the resulting reaction produces heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) . Such a reaction happens when grilling or pan frying meat . Creatine content ( as a percentage of crude protein ) can be used as an indicator of meat quality . </P> <P> A Meta - analysis from 2011 concluded that `` search for the excretion of heterocyclic amines remains a future task to definitively exclude the unproved allegation made by some national agencies '' . </P> <H3> Parkinson 's disease ( edit ) </H3> <P> Creatine 's impact on mitochondrial function has led to research on its efficacy and safety for slowing Parkinson 's disease . The current evidence base does not provide a reliable foundation for treatment decisions , due to risk of bias , small sample sizes , and the short duration of trials . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Adenosine triphosphate </Li> <Li> Beta - Alanine </Li> <Li> Creatine phosphate </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Entry `` creatine '' in Merriam - Webster Online Dictionary . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Wells , J.C.

The process of creatine synthesis occurs in two steps , catalyzed by L - arginine : glycine amidinotransferase ( AGAT ) and guanidinoacetate N - methyltransferase ( GAMT ) , which take place mainly in kidney and liver , respectively .

K3 C3 1994 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In Cold Blood is a non-fiction novel by American author Truman Capote , first published in 1966 ; it details the 1959 murders of four members of the Herbert Clutter family in the small farming community of Holcomb , Kansas . </P> <P> When Capote learned of the quadruple murder , before the killers were captured , he decided to travel to Kansas and write about the crime . He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee , and together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes . The killers , Richard `` Dick '' Hickock and Perry Smith , were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas . Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book . When finally published , In Cold Blood was an instant success , and today is the second - biggest - selling true crime book in publishing history , behind Vincent Bugliosi 's 1974 book Helter Skelter about the Charles Manson murders . </P> <P> Some critics consider Capote 's work the original non-fiction novel , though other writers had already explored the genre , such as Rodolfo Walsh in Operación Masacre ( 1957 ) . It has been especially lauded for its eloquent prose , extensive detail , and simultaneous triple narrative , which describes the lives of the murderers , the victims , and other members of the rural community in alternating sequences . The psychologies and backgrounds of Hickock and Smith are given special attention , as well as the complex relationship that existed between them during and after the murders . In Cold Blood is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true crime genre , though Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize . Critics have also noted that parts of the book , including important details , differ from the real events . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Overview of the crime </Li> <Li> 2 Capote 's research <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Veracity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Publication </Li> <Li> 4 Reviews and impact </Li> <Li> 5 Adaptations <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Film </Li> <Li> 5.2 Television </Li> <Li> 5.3 Graphic novel </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References <Ul> <Li> 7.1 General references </Li> <Li> 7.2 Inline citations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Overview of the crime ( edit ) </H2> <P> Herb Clutter was a prosperous farmer in western Kansas . He employed as many as 18 farmhands , who admired and respected him for his fair treatment and good wages . Two elder daughters , Eveanna and Beverly , had moved out and started their adult lives ; Nancy , 16 , and Kenyon , 15 , were in high school . Clutter 's wife Bonnie had reportedly been incapacitated by clinical depression and physical ailments since the births of her children , although this was later disputed . </P> <P> Two ex-convicts recently paroled from the Kansas State Penitentiary , Richard Eugene `` Dick '' Hickock and Perry Edward Smith , committed the robbery and murders in the early morning hours of November 15 , 1959 . A former cellmate of Hickock 's , Floyd Wells , had worked for Herb Clutter and told Hickock that Clutter kept large amounts of cash in a safe . Hickock soon hatched the idea to steal the safe and start a new life in Mexico . According to Capote , Hickock described his plan as `` a cinch , the perfect score . '' Hickock later contacted Smith , another former cellmate , about committing the robbery with him . In fact , Herb Clutter had no safe and did all his business by check . </P> <P> After driving more than four hundred miles across the state of Kansas on the evening of November 14 , Hickock and Smith arrived in Holcomb , located the Clutter home , and entered through an unlocked door while the family slept . Upon rousing the Clutters and discovering there was no safe , they bound and gagged the family and continued to search for money , but found little else of value in the house . Still determined to leave no witnesses , the pair briefly debated what to do ; Smith , notoriously unstable and prone to violent acts in fits of rage , slit Herb Clutter 's throat and then shot him in the head . Capote writes that Smith recounted later , `` I did n't want to harm the man . I thought he was a very nice gentleman . Soft spoken . I thought so right up to the moment I cut his throat . '' Kenyon , Nancy , and then Mrs. Clutter were also murdered , each by a single shotgun blast to the head . Hickock and Smith left the crime scene with a small portable radio , a pair of binoculars , and less than fifty dollars in cash . </P> <P> Smith later claimed in his oral confession that Hickock murdered the two women . When asked to sign his confession , however , Smith refused . According to Capote , he wanted to accept responsibility for all four killings because , he said , he was `` sorry for Dick 's mother . '' Smith added , `` She 's a real sweet person . '' Hickock always maintained that Smith committed all four killings . </P> <P> On the basis of a tip from Wells , who contacted the prison warden after hearing of the murders , Hickock and Smith were identified as suspects and arrested in Las Vegas on December 30 , 1959 . Both men eventually confessed after interrogations by detectives of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation . They were brought back to Kansas , where they were tried together for the murders . Their trial took place at the Finney County courthouse in Garden City , Kansas , from March 22 to March 29 , 1960 . They both pleaded temporary insanity at the trial , but local GPs evaluated the accused and pronounced them sane . The jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before finding both Hickock and Smith guilty of murder . Their conviction carried a mandatory death sentence at the time . </P> <P> After five years on death row at the Kansas State Penitentiary ( now known as Lansing Correctional Facility ) in Lansing , Kansas , Smith and Hickock were executed by hanging just after midnight on April 14 , 1965 . Hickock was executed first and was pronounced dead at 12 : 41 a.m. after hanging for nearly 20 minutes . Smith followed shortly after and was pronounced dead at 1 : 19 a.m. Warden Official Greg Seamon presided over the executions in Lansing . The gallows used in their executions now forms part of the collections of the Kansas State Historical Society . </P> <P> Hickock and Smith are also suspected of involvement in the Walker family murders , a notion which is mentioned in the book , though this connection has not been proven . </P> <H2> Capote 's research ( edit ) </H2> Clutter family home in Holcomb , Kansas , in March 2009 . <P> Capote became interested in the murders after reading about it in The New York Times . He brought his childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee ( who would later win the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her novel To Kill a Mockingbird ) to help gain the confidence of the locals in Kansas . Capote did copious research for the book , ultimately compiling 8,000 pages of notes . Capote 's research also included letters from Smith 's Army buddy , Don Cullivan , who was present during the trial . After the criminals were found , tried , and convicted , Capote conducted personal interviews with both Smith and Hickock. Smith especially fascinated Capote ; in the book he is portrayed as the more sensitive and guilt - ridden of the two killers . The book was not completed until after Smith and Hickock were executed . </P> <P> An alternate explanation for Capote 's interest holds that The New Yorker presented the Clutter story to him as one of two choices for a story , the other being to follow a Manhattan cleaning woman on her rounds . Capote supposedly chose the Clutter story , believing it would be the easier assignment . Capote later did write a piece about following a cleaning woman , which he entitled `` A Day 's Work '' and included in his book Music for Chameleons . </P> <H3> Veracity ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Cold Blood brought Capote much praise from the literary community . Yet despite the book 's billing as a factual account , critics have questioned its veracity , arguing that Capote changed facts to suit the story , added scenes that had never taken place , and manufactured dialogue . Writing in Esquire in 1966 , Phillip K. Tompkins noted factual discrepancies after he traveled to Kansas and talked to some of the same people interviewed by Capote . In a telephone interview with Tompkins , Josephine Meier , the wife of Finney County Undersheriff Wendle Meier , denied that she heard Smith cry and that she held his hand as described by Capote . In Cold Blood indicates that Meier and Smith became close , yet she told Tompkins she spent little time with Smith and did not talk much with him . Tompkins concluded : </P> <P> Capote has , in short , achieved a work of art . He has told exceedingly well a tale of high terror in his own way . But , despite the brilliance of his self - publicizing efforts , he has made both a tactical and a moral error that will hurt him in the short run . By insisting that ' every word ' of his book is true he has made himself vulnerable to those readers who are prepared to examine seriously such a sweeping claim . </P> <P> True crime writer Jack Olsen also commented on the alleged fabrications : </P> <P> I recognized it as a work of art , but I know fakery when I see it , ( ... ) Capote completely fabricated quotes and whole scenes ... The book made something like $6 million in 1960s money , and nobody wanted to discuss anything wrong with a moneymaker like that in the publishing business . </P> <P> His criticisms were quoted in Esquire , to which Capote replied , `` Jack Olsen is just jealous . '' </P> <P> That was true , of course , ( ... ) I was jealous -- all that money ? I 'd been assigned the Clutter case by Harper & Row until we found out that Capote and his cousin ( sic ) , Harper Lee , had been already on the case in Dodge City for six months . ( ... ) That book did two things . It made true crime an interesting , successful , commercial genre , but it also began the process of tearing it down . I blew the whistle in my own weak way . I 'd only published a couple of books at that time -- but since it was such a superbly written book , nobody wanted to hear about it . </P> <P> Alvin Dewey , the lead investigator portrayed in In Cold Blood , later said that the last scene , in which he visits the Clutters ' graves , was Capote 's invention , while other Kansas residents whom Capote interviewed have claimed they or their relatives were mischaracterized or misquoted . Dewey said that the rest of the book was factually accurate . Further evidence indicates that the book is not as `` immaculately factual '' as Capote had always claimed it to be . The book depicts Dewey as being the brilliant investigator who cracks the Clutter murder case , but files recovered from the Kansas Bureau of Investigation show that when Floyd Wells came forward naming Richard Hickock and Perry Smith as likely suspects , Dewey did not immediately act on the information , as the book portrays him doing , because Dewey still held to his belief that the murders were committed by locals who `` had a grudge against Herb Clutter '' . </P> <H2> Publication ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Cold Blood was first published as a four - part serial in The New Yorker , beginning with the September 25 , 1965 issue . The piece was an immediate sensation , particularly in Kansas , where the usual number of New Yorker copies sold out immediately . In Cold Blood was first published in book form by Random House in January 1966 . The book , however , was copyrighted in 1965 , and this date appears on the title page of most printings of the book and even in some library indices as the original publication date . The Library of Congress lists 1966 as the publication date and 1965 as the copyright date . </P> <P> The cover , which was designed by S. Neil Fujita , shows a hatpin with what appeared originally as a red drop of blood at its top end . After Capote first saw the design , he requested that the drop be made a deeper shade of red to represent the passage of time since the incident . A black border was added to the ominous image . </P> <H2> Reviews and impact ( edit ) </H2> <P> Writing for The New York Times , Conrad Knickerbocker gave praise to Capote 's talent for detail throughout the novel and declared the book a `` masterpiece '' -- an `` agonizing , terrible , possessed , proof that the times , so surfeited with disasters , are still capable of tragedy '' . </P> <P> In a controversial review of the novel published in 1966 for The New Republic , Stanley Kauffmann , criticising Capote 's writing style throughout the novel , states that he `` demonstrates on almost every page that he is the most outrageously overrated stylist of our time '' and later asserts that `` the depth in this book is no deeper than its mine - shaft of factual detail ; its height is rarely higher than that of good journalism and often falls below it . '' </P> <P> Tom Wolfe wrote in his essay `` Pornoviolence '' : `` The book is neither a who - done - it nor a will - they - be-caught , since the answers to both questions are known from the outset ... Instead , the book 's suspense is based largely on a totally new idea in detective stories : the promise of gory details , and the withholding of them until the end . '' </P> <P> In The Independent 's Book of a Lifetime series , reviewer Kate Colquhoun asserts that `` the book -- for which he made a reputed 8000 pages of research notes -- is plotted and structured with taut writerly flair . Its characters pulse with recognisable life ; its places are palpable . Careful prose binds the reader to his unfolding story . Put simply , the book was conceived of journalism and born of a novelist . '' </P> <H2> Adaptations ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Film ( edit ) </H3> <P> Three film adaptations based upon the book have been produced . The first focuses on the details of the book , whereas the later two explore Capote 's fascination with researching the novel . The first adaptation was the 1967 film of the same name by Richard Brooks , who directed and adapted the screenplay . It starred Robert Blake as Perry Smith and Scott Wilson as Richard Hickock .

( March 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The tallest building in the world as of 2017 is Burj Khalifa . Before Burj Khalifa , the title of `` world 's tallest building '' has been borne by various buildings , such as Rouen Cathedral and the Empire State Building . </P> <P> The skyscraper was invented in Chicago in 1884 . For the next hundred years , the world 's tallest building was always in the United States with New York City accumulating 86 years , and Chicago accumulating 30 years . After just over a century ( 1885 -- 1998 ) the distinction moved to the Eastern Hemisphere . Malaysia was the first country to break United States ' record of building tallest buildings in the world by building Petronas Twin Towers in 1998 , which held the record for 6 years before losing it to Taipei 101 in 2004 . Before the current era of commercial skyscrapers , there was an era where the tallest buildings were Christian churches / cathedrals ( c. 1250 -- 1901 ) , dominated by England and Germanic territories . </P> <P> Before this time , it is not possible to conclusively state what was the tallest building in the world . For instance , the Lighthouse of Alexandria ( completed about 280 BC ) was very tall , but its true height is not known . For thousands of years , the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world , but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it was not habitable . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Definition of terms <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Meaning of `` building '' </Li> <Li> 1.2 Determination of height </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Tallest buildings ( 13th century -- 1901 ) <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Churches and cathedrals </Li> <Li> 2.2 Skyscrapers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Tallest buildings ( from 1901 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Charts <Ul> <Li> 4.1 1870 -- present </Li> <Li> 4.2 1300 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History of increment in height of skyscrapers </Li> <Li> 6 History of supertall skyscrapers by location </Li> <Li> 7 Increment in usage of skyscrapers </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Definition of terms ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Meaning of `` building '' ( edit ) </H3> <P> The earliest structures now known to be the tallest in the world were the Egyptian pyramids , with the Great Pyramid of Giza , at an original height of 146.5 metres ( 481 ft ) , being the tallest man -- made structure in the world for over 3,800 years , until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1300 . From then until the completion of the Washington Monument ( capped in 1884 ) the world 's tallest buildings were churches or cathedrals . Later , the Eiffel Tower and , still later , some radio masts and television towers were the world 's tallest structures . </P> <P> However , though all of these are structures , some are not buildings in the sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied . It is in this sense of being regularly inhabited or occupied that the term `` building '' is generally understood to mean when determining what is the world 's tallest building . The non-profit international organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat ( CTBUH ) , which maintains a set of criteria for determining the height of tall buildings , defines a `` building '' as `` ( A ) structure that is designed for residential , business or manufacturing purposes '' and `` has floors '' . </P> <P> Tall churches and cathedrals occupy a middle ground : their lower areas are regularly occupied , but much of their height is in bell towers and spires which are not . Whether a church or cathedral is a `` building '' or merely a `` structure '' for the purposes of determining the title of `` world 's tallest building '' is a subjective matter of definition ( this article treats churches and cathedrals as buildings ) . </P> <H3> Determination of height ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat based in Chicago uses three different criteria for determining the height of a tall building , each of which may give a different result . `` Height of the highest floor '' is one criterion , and `` height to the top of any part of the building '' is another , but the default criterion used by the CTBUH is `` height of the architectural top of the building '' , which includes spires but not antennae , masts or flag poles . </P> <H2> Tallest buildings ( 13th century -- 1901 ) ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Churches and cathedrals ( edit ) </H3> Tallest buildings diagram from 1850 <P> From the 13th century until 1901 , the world 's tallest building was always a church or cathedral . In the 13th century Old St Paul 's Cathedral with its spire was completed . Completed in the early 14th century , the central spire of Lincoln Cathedral surpassed it . In 1549 this spire collapsed , beginning a long sequence where the status of world 's tallest building was borne by shorter and shorter buildings . On the collapse of Lincoln Cathedral 's spire , then St. Mary 's Church in Stralsund became the world 's tallest building . In 1647 , the bell tower of St. Mary 's burned down , thus making the shorter Strasbourg Cathedral the world 's tallest building . </P> <P> It was not until the completion of the Ulm Minster in 1890 that the world 's tallest building was again also the tallest building ever , surpassing the original configuration of Lincoln Cathedral . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Years tallest </Td> <Td> Name </Td> <Td> Location </Td> <Td> Height </Td> <Td> Increase </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 13th century -- 1300 </Td> <Td> Old St Paul 's Cathedral * </Td> <Td> London </Td> <Td> 149 metres ( 489 ft ) </Td> <Td> 1.7 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1300 -- 1549 </Td> <Td> Lincoln Cathedral * </Td> <Td> Lincoln </Td> <Td> 159.7 metres ( 524 ft ) </Td> <Td> 6.7 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1549 -- 1647 </Td> <Td> St. Mary 's Church </Td> <Td> Stralsund </Td> <Td> 151 metres ( 495 ft ) </Td> <Td> - 5.8 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1647 -- 1874 </Td> <Td> Strasbourg Cathedral </Td> <Td> Strasbourg </Td> <Td> 142 metres ( 466 ft ) </Td> <Td> - 6.3 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1874 -- 1876 </Td> <Td> Church of St. Nicholas </Td> <Td> Hamburg </Td> <Td> 147 metres ( 482 ft ) </Td> <Td> 3.4 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1876 -- 1880 </Td> <Td> Rouen Cathedral </Td> <Td> Rouen </Td> <Td> 151 metres ( 495 ft ) </Td> <Td> 2.6 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1880 -- 1890 </Td> <Td> Cologne Cathedral </Td> <Td> Cologne </Td> <Td> 157.38 metres ( 516.3 ft ) </Td> <Td> 4.1 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1890 -- 1901 </Td> <Td> Ulm Minster * </Td> <Td> Ulm </Td> <Td> 161.53 metres ( 530.0 ft ) </Td> <Td> 2.6 % </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> * -- Also set record at time of completion as tallest building ever built . </P> <P> The 524 feet ( 160 m ) height of Lincoln Cathedral is disputed by some , but accepted by most sources . The completion date for the spire is given as 1311 rather than 1300 by some sources . Also the 489 feet ( 149 m ) height of the spire of Old St Paul 's Cathedral , destroyed by lightning in 1561 , is disputed , for example Christopher Wren ( 1632 -- 1723 ) judged that an overestimate and gave a height of 460 feet ( 140 m ) . </P> <P> The top of the spire of the Antonelli Edifice in Turin , completed in 1889 , is 167.5 metres ( 550 ft ) tall . However , the upper part of the structure was destroyed by a 1953 tornado and rebuilt . If the original spire top was 167.5 metres ( as claimed by some sources ) , the Antonelli Edifice might have been the world 's tallest building from 1889 to 1908 . </P> <H3> Skyscrapers ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Early skyscrapers <P> In the 19th Century , a new kind of structure was developed in Shrewsbury , UK using an iron or steel internal structure ( instead of the outer walls ) to bear the building 's weight . The taller of these buildings are called skyscrapers . The Ditherington Flax Mill was the first iron framed building , and for this reason is often seen as ' the world 's first skyscraper ' , despite being only five storeys tall .

Other criteria would generate a different list . Shanghai World Financial Center is not on the above list , but it surpassed Taipei 101 in 2008 to become the building with the highest occupied floor . Using the criteria of highest tip ( including antennae ) , the World Trade Center in New York City was the world 's tallest building from 1972 to 2000 , until the Sears Tower in Chicago ( which already had a higher occupied floor than the World Trade Center ) had its antenna extended to give that building the world 's tallest tip ; a title it held until the 2010 completion of Burj Khalifa . Petronas Towers and Taipei 101 were never the world 's tallest buildings by the highest -- tip criteria . </P> <P> Since 2010 , Burj Khalifa has been the tallest building by any criteria . It has the highest architectural element , tip and occupied floor , and is indeed the tallest structure of any kind ever built , surpassing the ( now destroyed ) 646.38 metres ( 2,120.7 ft ) Warsaw Radio Mast . </P> <P> Since the completion of the Washington Monument in 1884 , the world 's tallest building has not usually also been the world 's tallest structure . The exceptions are 1930 -- 1954 , when the Chrysler Building and then the Empire State building surpassed the Eiffel Tower ( to be surpassed in turn by a succession of broadcast masts , starting with the Griffin Television Tower in Oklahoma ) , and from 2010 with the completion of Burj Khalifa . </P> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1870 -- present ( edit ) </H3> <P> </P> <H3> 1300 -- present ( edit ) </H3> <P> In this chart , time progresses from right to left . Note the early buildings that lost the title as their spires collapsed . </P> <P> </P> <H2> History of increment in height of skyscrapers ( edit ) </H2> <P> After the construction of the Home Insurance Building in Chicago in the 19th century , the incrementation in the height of skyscrapers began with the construction of the Chrysler Building , followed by the Empire State Building , in New York City . The Chrysler Building was the first building in the world to break the 300 metres ( 984 ft ) barrier , and the Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors . It stands at 381 metres ( 1,250 ft ) and has 102 floors . The next tallest skyscraper was the World Trade Center , which was completed in 1971 . The north tower was 417 m ( 1,368 ft ) and the south 415 m ( 1,362 ft ) tall . It surpassed the height of the Empire State Building by 36 m ( 118 ft ) . Two years later the Sears Tower was built in Chicago , standing at 442 m ( 1,450 ft ) with 110 floors , surpassing the height of the World Trade Center by 25 metres ( 82 ft ) . The Petronas Towers rose 10 meters above the Sears Tower , standing at a height of 452 m ( 1,483 ft ) and each having 88 floors . </P> <P> In 2004 , the construction of Taipei 101 brought the height of skyscrapers to a new level , standing at 509 m ( 1,670 ft ) with 101 floors . It is 59 metres ( 194 ft ) taller than the previous record holders , the Petronas Towers . Burj Khalifa surpassed the height of Taipei 101 by 319 metres ( 1,047 ft ) in 2009 , making it 60 % taller . It has broken several skyscraper records , and it is almost twice as tall as the Empire State Building . Burj Khalifa has also broken the record of the world 's tallest structure . </P> <Ul> <Li> NOTE : The CTBUH defines a building as a supertall if it is 300 metres ( 984 ft ) or taller . </Li> </Ul> <H2> History of supertall skyscrapers by location ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since the early skyscraper boom that took place in North America , the significant number of skyscrapers in North America have dominated the 100 tallest buildings in the world . In 1930 , 99 of the 100 tallest buildings in the world were located in North America . In the future , this percentage is expected to decline to only 22 percent . The predominance of skyscrapers in North America is decreasing due to the building of skyscraper construction in other parts of the world , especially in Asia , that are finally catching up to progress that began in North America in the 19th century . </P> <P> In Asia , there has been an increase in the number of supertall skyscrapers beginning with the construction of Petronas Twin Towers . There are currently sixty buildings in the world 's 100 tallest that are located in Asia ( including the Middle East ) . However , skyscraper construction is still prevalent in the United States . </P> <H2> Increment in usage of skyscrapers ( edit ) </H2> <P> Since the skyscraper boom , the great majority of skyscrapers in the world were used predominantly as office space . From 1930 to 2000 the percentage of office towers never fell below 86 percent , but in the future it is expected to be as low as 46 percent . In 2010 less than half of the 100 tallest buildings in the world were office towers with the majority utilized as residential and mixed use . Today , only four out of the ten tallest buildings in the world , and twenty eight out of the fifty tallest in the world , are used primarily as offices . </P> <P> A mixed - use tall building contains two or more functions ( uses ) , where each of the functions occupies a significant proportion of the tower 's total space . Support areas such as car parks and mechanical plant space do not contribute towards mixed - use status . </P> <P> Skyscrapers used as hotels and as residential space are generally smaller . There are only a few super tall skyscrapers of that type among the 100 tallest skyscrapers in the world . The tallest residential building in the world is 432 Park Avenue . There are few supertall hotel skyscrapers in the world . The Emirates Park Towers Hotel & Spa , Rose Tower and Burj Al Arab are the only three supertall hotels standing , while the topped - out Emirates Park Towers Hotel & Spa is currently the tallest hotel in the world at 377 m ( 1,237 ft ) . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> History portal </Li> <Li> Architecture portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> History of tallest skyscrapers </Li> <Li> List of tallest buildings and structures </Li> <Li> List of Egyptian pyramids </Li> <Li> List of tallest buildings </Li> <Li> List of tallest churches </Li> <Li> List of tallest structures built before the 20th century </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dd> A . This significant proportion can be judged as 15 % or greater of either the total floor area , or the total building height in terms of number of floors occupied for the function . However , care should be taken in the case of supertall buildings . For example , a 20 - story hotel function as part of a 150 - story tower does not comply with the 15 % rule , though this would clearly constitute mixed use . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Marshall Gerometta . `` Height : The History of Measuring Tall Buildings '' .

For other uses , see Distance ( disambiguation ) . <P> Distance is a numerical description of how far apart objects are . In physics or everyday usage , distance may refer to a physical length , or an estimation based on other criteria ( e.g. `` two counties over '' ) . In most cases , `` distance from A to B '' is interchangeable with `` distance from B to A '' . In mathematics , a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance . A metric is a function that behaves according to a specific set of rules , and is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be `` close to '' or `` far away from '' each other . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Overview and definitions <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Physical distances </Li> <Li> 1.2 Theoretical distances </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Distance versus directed distance and displacement <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Directed distance </Li> <Li> 2.2 Displacement </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Mathematics <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Geometry </Li> <Li> 3.2 Distance in Euclidean space </Li> <Li> 3.3 Variational formulation of distance </Li> <Li> 3.4 Generalization to higher - dimensional objects </Li> <Li> 3.5 Algebraic distance </Li> <Li> 3.6 General metric </Li> <Li> 3.7 Distances between sets and between a point and a set </Li> <Li> 3.8 Graph theory </Li> <Li> 3.9 Other mathematical `` distances '' </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Overview and definitions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Physical distances ( edit ) </H3> Airline routes between Los Angeles and Tokyo approximately follow a direct great circle route ( top ) , but use the jet stream ( bottom ) when heading eastwards . Note that the shortest route appears as a curve rather than a straight line because this map is a Mercator projection , which does not scale all distances equally compared to the real spherical surface of the Earth . `` Manhattan distance '' on a grid <P> A physical distance can mean several different things : </P> <Ul> <Li> The length of a specific path traveled between two points , such as the distance walked while navigating a maze </Li> </Ul> A board showing distances near Visakhapatnam <Ul> <Li> The length of the shortest possible path through space between two point that could be taken if there were no obstacles ( usually formalized as Euclidean distance ) </Li> <Li> The length of the shortest path between two points while remaining on some surface , such as the great - circle distance along the curve of the Earth </Li> </Ul> <P> `` Circular distance '' is the distance traveled by a wheel , which can be useful when designing vehicles or mechanical gears . The circumference of the wheel is 2π × radius , and assuming the radius to be 1 , then each revolution of the wheel is equivalent of the distance 2π radians . In engineering ω = 2πƒ is often used , where ƒ is the frequency . </P> <P> Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations , but are also used in theoretical mathematics : </P> <Ul> <Li> `` Manhattan distance '' is a rectilinear distance , named after the number of blocks north , south , east , or west a taxicab must travel on to reach its destination on the grid of streets in parts of New York City . </Li> <Li> `` Chessboard distance '' , formalized as Chebyshev distance , is the minimum number of moves a king must make on a chessboard to travel between two squares . </Li> </Ul> <P> Distance measures in cosmology are complicated by the expansion of the universe , and by effects described by the theory of relativity such as length contraction of moving objects . </P> <H3> Theoretical distances ( edit ) </H3> <P> The term `` distance '' is also used by analogy to measure non-physical entities in certain ways . </P> <P> In computer science , there is the notion of the `` edit distance '' between two strings . For example , the words `` dog '' and `` dot '' , which vary by only one letter , are closer than `` dog '' and `` cat '' , which differ by three letters . This idea is used in spell checkers and in coding theory , and is mathematically formalized in several different ways , such as : </P> <Ul> <Li> Levenshtein distance </Li> <Li> Hamming distance </Li> <Li> Lee distance </Li> <Li> Jaro -- Winkler distance </Li> <Li> N - gram distance </Li> </Ul> <P> In mathematics , a metric space is a set for which distances between all members of the set are defined . In this way , many different types of `` distances '' can be calculated , such as for traversal of graphs , comparison of distributions and curves , and using unusual definitions of `` space '' ( for example using a manifold or reflections ) . The notion of distance in graph theory has been used to describe social networks , for example with the Erdős number or the Bacon number , the number of collaborative relationships away a person is from prolific mathematician Paul Erdős or actor Kevin Bacon , respectively . </P> <P> In psychology , human geography , and the social sciences , distance is often theorized not as an objective metric , but as a subjective experience . </P> <H2> Distance versus directed distance and displacement ( edit ) </H2> Distance along a path compared with displacement <P> Distance can not be negative , and distance travelled never decreases . Distance is a scalar quantity or a magnitude , whereas displacement is a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction . Directed distance is a positive , zero , or negative scalar quantity . </P> <P> The distance covered by a vehicle ( for example as recorded by an odometer ) , person , animal , or object along a curved path from a point A to a point B should be distinguished from the straight - line distance from A to B. For example , whatever the distance covered during a round trip from A to B and back to A , the displacement is zero as start and end points coincide . In general the straight - line distance does not equal distance travelled , except for journeys in a straight line . </P> <H3> Directed distance ( edit ) </H3> <P> Directed distances are distances with a directional sense . They can be determined along straight lines and along curved lines . A directed distance of a point C from point A in the direction of B on a line AB in a Euclidean vector space is the distance from A to C if C falls on the ray AB , but is the negative of that distance if C falls on the ray BA ( I.e. , if C is not on the same side of A as B is ) . </P> <P> A directed distance along a curved line is not a vector and is represented by a segment of that curved line defined by endpoints A and B , with some specific information indicating the sense ( or direction ) of an ideal or real motion from one endpoint of the segment to the other ( see figure ) . For instance , just labelling the two endpoints as A and B can indicate the sense , if the ordered sequence ( A , B) is assumed , which implies that A is the starting point . </P> <H3> Displacement ( edit ) </H3> <P> A displacement ( see above ) is a special kind of directed distance defined in mechanics . A directed distance is called displacement when it is the distance along a straight line ( minimum distance ) from A and B , and when A and B are positions occupied by the same particle at two different instants of time . This implies motion of the particle . The distance traveled by a particle must always be greater than or equal to its displacement , with equality occurring only when the particle moves along a straight path . </P> <P> Another kind of directed distance is that between two different particles or point masses at a given time . For instance , the distance from the center of gravity of the Earth A and the center of gravity of the Moon B ( which does not strictly imply motion from A to B) falls into this category . </P> <H2> Mathematics ( edit ) </H2> See also : Metric ( mathematics ) <H3> Geometry ( edit ) </H3> <P> In analytic geometry , the distance between two points of the xy - plane can be found using the distance formula . The distance between ( x , y ) and ( x , y ) is given by : </P> <Dl> <Dd> d = ( Δ x ) 2 + ( Δ y ) 2 = ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 . ( \\ displaystyle d = ( \\ sqrt ( ( \\ Delta x ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( \\ Delta y ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) = ( \\ sqrt ( ( x_ ( 2 ) - x_ ( 1 ) ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( y_ ( 2 ) - y_ ( 1 ) ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Similarly , given points ( x , y , z ) and ( x , y , z ) in three - space , the distance between them is : </P> <Dl> <Dd> d = ( Δ x ) 2 + ( Δ y ) 2 + ( Δ z ) 2 = ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 + ( z 2 − z 1 ) 2 . ( \\ displaystyle d = ( \\ sqrt ( ( \\ Delta x ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( \\ Delta y ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( \\ Delta z ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) = ( \\ sqrt ( ( x_ ( 2 ) - x_ ( 1 ) ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( y_ ( 2 ) - y_ ( 1 ) ) ^ ( 2 ) + ( z_ ( 2 ) - z_ ( 1 ) ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> These formula are easily derived by constructing a right triangle with a leg on the hypotenuse of another ( with the other leg orthogonal to the plane that contains the 1st triangle ) and applying the Pythagorean theorem . In the study of complicated geometries , we call this ( most common ) type of distance Euclidean distance , as it is derived from the Pythagorean theorem , which does not hold in non-Euclidean geometries . This distance formula can also be expanded into the arc - length formula . </P> <H3> Distance in Euclidean space ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the Euclidean space R , the distance between two points is usually given by the Euclidean distance ( 2 - norm distance ) . Other distances , based on other norms , are sometimes used instead . </P> <P> For a point ( x , x , ... , x ) and a point ( y , y , ... , y ) , the Minkowski distance of order p ( p - norm distance ) is defined as : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> 1 - norm distance </Td> <Td> = ∑ i = 1 n x i − y i ( \\ displaystyle = \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( n ) \\ left x_ ( i ) - y_ ( i ) \\ right ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 - norm distance </Td> <Td> = ( ∑ i = 1 n x i − y i 2 ) 1 / 2 ( \\ displaystyle = \\ left ( \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( n ) \\ left x_ ( i ) - y_ ( i ) \\ right ^ ( 2 ) \\ right ) ^ ( 1 / 2 ) ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> p - norm distance </Td> <Td> = ( ∑ i = 1 n x i − y i p ) 1 / p ( \\ displaystyle = \\ left ( \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( n ) \\ left x_ ( i ) - y_ ( i ) \\ right ^ ( p ) \\ right ) ^ ( 1 / p ) ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> infinity norm distance </Td> <Td> = lim p → ∞ ( ∑ i = 1 n x i − y i p ) 1 / p ( \\ displaystyle = \\ lim _ ( p \\ to \\ infty ) \\ left ( \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( n ) \\ left x_ ( i ) - y_ ( i ) \\ right ^ ( p ) \\ right ) ^ ( 1 / p ) ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> = max ( x 1 − y 1 , x 2 − y 2 , ... , x n − y n ) . ( \\ displaystyle = \\ max \\ left ( x_ ( 1 ) - y_ ( 1 ) , x_ ( 2 ) - y_ ( 2 ) , \\ ldots , x_ ( n ) - y_ ( n ) \\ right ) . ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> p need not be an integer , but it can not be less than 1 , because otherwise the triangle inequality does not hold . </P> <P> The 2 - norm distance is the Euclidean distance , a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to more than two coordinates . It is what would be obtained if the distance between two points were measured with a ruler : the `` intuitive '' idea of distance . </P> <P> The 1 - norm distance is more colourfully called the taxicab norm or Manhattan distance , because it is the distance a car would drive in a city laid out in square blocks ( if there are no one - way streets ) . </P> <P> The infinity norm distance is also called Chebyshev distance . In 2D , it is the minimum number of moves kings require to travel between two squares on a chessboard . </P> <P> The p - norm is rarely used for values of p other than 1 , 2 , and infinity , but see super ellipse . </P> <P> In physical space the Euclidean distance is in a way the most natural one , because in this case the length of a rigid body does not change with rotation . </P> <H3> Variational formulation of distance ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Euclidean distance between two points in space ( A = r → ( 0 ) ( \\ displaystyle A = ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( 0 ) ) and B = r → ( T ) ( \\ displaystyle B = ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( T ) ) ) may be written in a variational form where the distance is the minimum value of an integral : </P> <Dl> <Dd> D = ∫ 0 T ( ∂ r → ( t ) ∂ t ) 2 d t ( \\ displaystyle D = \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( T ) ( \\ sqrt ( \\ left ( ( \\ partial ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( t ) \\ over \\ partial t ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) \\ , dt ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Here r → ( t ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( t ) ) is the trajectory ( path ) between the two points . The value of the integral ( D ) represents the length of this trajectory . The distance is the minimal value of this integral and is obtained when r = r ∗ ( \\ displaystyle r = r ^ ( * ) ) where r ∗ ( \\ displaystyle r ^ ( * ) ) is the optimal trajectory . In the familiar Euclidean case ( the above integral ) this optimal trajectory is simply a straight line . It is well known that the shortest path between two points is a straight line . Straight lines can formally be obtained by solving the Euler -- Lagrange equations for the above functional . In non-Euclidean manifolds ( curved spaces ) where the nature of the space is represented by a metric tensor g a b ( \\ displaystyle g_ ( ab ) ) the integrand has to be modified to g a c r ̇ c g a b r ̇ b ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ sqrt ( g ^ ( ac ) ( \\ dot ( r ) ) _ ( c ) g_ ( ab ) ( \\ dot ( r ) ) ^ ( b ) ) ) ) , where Einstein summation convention has been used . </P> <H3> Generalization to higher - dimensional objects ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Euclidean distance between two objects may also be generalized to the case where the objects are no longer points but are higher - dimensional manifolds , such as space curves , so in addition to talking about distance between two points one can discuss concepts of distance between two strings . Since the new objects that are dealt with are extended objects ( not points anymore ) additional concepts such as non-extensibility , curvature constraints , and non-local interactions that enforce non-crossing become central to the notion of distance . The distance between the two manifolds is the scalar quantity that results from minimizing the generalized distance functional , which represents a transformation between the two manifolds : </P> <Dl> <Dd> D = ∫ 0 L ∫ 0 T ( ( ∂ r → ( s , t ) ∂ t ) 2 + λ ( ( ∂ r → ( s , t ) ∂ s ) 2 − 1 ) ) d s d t ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ mathcal ( D ) ) = \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( L ) \\ int _ ( 0 ) ^ ( T ) \\ left \\ ( ( \\ sqrt ( \\ left ( ( \\ partial ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s , t ) \\ over \\ partial t ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) + \\ lambda \\ left ( ( \\ sqrt ( \\ left ( ( \\ partial ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s , t ) \\ over \\ partial s ) \\ right ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) - 1 \\ right ) \\ right \\ ) \\ , ds \\ , dt ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> The above double integral is the generalized distance functional between two polymer conformation . s ( \\ displaystyle s ) is a spatial parameter and t ( \\ displaystyle t ) is pseudo-time . This means that r → ( s , t = t i ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s , t = t_ ( i ) ) ) is the polymer / string conformation at time t i ( \\ displaystyle t_ ( i ) ) and is parameterized along the string length by s ( \\ displaystyle s ) . Similarly r → ( s = S , t ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s = S , t ) ) is the trajectory of an infinitesimal segment of the string during transformation of the entire string from conformation r → ( s , 0 ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s , 0 ) ) to conformation r → ( s , T ) ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ vec ( r ) ) ( s , T ) ) . The term with cofactor λ ( \\ displaystyle \\ lambda ) is a Lagrange multiplier and its role is to ensure that the length of the polymer remains the same during the transformation . If two discrete polymers are inextensible , then the minimal - distance transformation between them no longer involves purely straight - line motion , even on a Euclidean metric . There is a potential application of such generalized distance to the problem of protein folding This generalized distance is analogous to the Nambu -- Goto action in string theory , however there is no exact correspondence because the Euclidean distance in 3 - space is inequivalent to the spacetime distance minimized for the classical relativistic string . </P> <H3> Algebraic distance ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2008 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> This is a metric often used in computer vision that can be minimized by least squares estimation. ( 1 ) ( 2 ) For curves or surfaces given by the equation x T C x = 0 ( \\ displaystyle x ^ ( \\ text ( T ) ) Cx = 0 ) ( such as a conic in homogeneous coordinates ) , the algebraic distance from the point x ′ ( \\ displaystyle x ' ) to the curve is simply x ′ T C x ′ ( \\ displaystyle x ' ^ ( \\ text ( T ) ) Cx ' ) . It may serve as an `` initial guess '' for geometric distance to refine estimations of the curve by more accurate methods , such as non-linear least squares . </P> <H3> General metric ( edit ) </H3> <P> In mathematics , in particular geometry , a distance function on a given set M is a function d : M × M → R , where R denotes the set of real numbers , that satisfies the following conditions : </P> <Ul> <Li> d ( x , y ) ≥ 0 , and d ( x , y ) = 0 if and only if x = y . ( Distance is positive between two different points , and is zero precisely from a point to itself . ) </Li> <Li> It is symmetric : d ( x , y ) = d ( y , x ) . ( The distance between x and y is the same in either direction . ) </Li> <Li> It satisfies the triangle inequality : d ( x , z ) ≤ d ( x , y ) + d ( y , z ) . ( The distance between two points is the shortest distance along any path ) . Such a distance function is known as a metric . Together with the set , it makes up a metric space . </Li> </Ul> <P> For example , the usual definition of distance between two real numbers x and y is : d ( x , y ) = x − y . This definition satisfies the three conditions above , and corresponds to the standard topology of the real line . But distance on a given set is a definitional choice . Another possible choice is to define : d ( x , y ) = 0 if x = y , and 1 otherwise . This also defines a metric , but gives a completely different topology , the `` discrete topology '' ; with this definition numbers can not be arbitrarily close . </P> <H3> Distances between sets and between a point and a set ( edit ) </H3> d ( A , B) > d ( A , C ) + d ( C , B) <P> Various distance definitions are possible between objects . For example , between celestial bodies one should not confuse the surface - to - surface distance and the center - to - center distance . If the former is much less than the latter , as for a low earth orbit , the first tends to be quoted ( altitude ) , otherwise , e.g. for the Earth -- Moon distance , the latter . </P> <P> There are two common definitions for the distance between two non-empty subsets of a given metric space : </P> <Ul> <Li> One version of distance between two non-empty sets is the infimum of the distances between any two of their respective points , which is the everyday meaning of the word , i.e. </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> d ( A , B ) = inf x ∈ A , y ∈ B d ( x , y ) . ( \\ displaystyle d ( A , B ) = \\ inf _ ( x \\ in A , y \\ in B ) d ( x , y ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> <Dd> This is a symmetric premetric . On a collection of sets of which some touch or overlap each other , it is not `` separating '' , because the distance between two different but touching or overlapping sets is zero . Also it is not hemimetric , i.e. , the triangle inequality does not hold , except in special cases . Therefore only in special cases this distance makes a collection of sets a metric space . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> The Hausdorff distance is the larger of two values , one being the supremum , for a point ranging over one set , of the infimum , for a second point ranging over the other set , of the distance between the points , and the other value being likewise defined but with the roles of the two sets swapped . This distance makes the set of non-empty compact subsets of a metric space itself a metric space . </Li> </Ul> <P> The distance between a point and a set is the infimum of the distances between the point and those in the set . This corresponds to the distance , according to the first - mentioned definition above of the distance between sets , from the set containing only this point to the other set . </P> <P> In terms of this , the definition of the Hausdorff distance can be simplified : it is the larger of two values , one being the supremum , for a point ranging over one set , of the distance between the point and the set , and the other value being likewise defined but with the roles of the two sets swapped . </P> <H3> Graph theory ( edit ) </H3> <P> In graph theory the distance between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between those vertices . </P> <H3> Other mathematical `` distances '' ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Canberra distance -- a weighted version of Manhattan distance , used in computer science </Li> <Li> Energy distance , the statistical distance between probability distributions </Li> <Li> Kullback -- Leibler divergence , which measures the difference between two probability distributions </Li> <Li> Mahalanobis distance is used in statistics </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikiquote has quotations related to : Distance </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Astronomical system of units </Li> <Li> Cosmic distance ladder </Li> <Li> Distance geometry problem </Li> <Li> Dijkstra 's algorithm </Li> <Li> Distance matrix </Li> <Li> Distance measuring equipment ( DME ) </Li> <Li> Distance - based road exit numbers </Li> <Li> Engineering tolerance </Li> <Li> Length </Li> <Li> Meridian arc </Li> <Li> Milestone </Li> <Li> Orders of magnitude ( length ) </Li> <Li> Proper length </Li> <Li> Proxemics -- physical distance between people </Li> <Li> Rangefinder </Li> <Li> Signed distance function </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Notes </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Simandan , Dragos ( 2016 ) . `` Proximity , subjectivity , and space : Rethinking distance in human geography '' .

He has taken a job as a history teacher at John Quincy Adams Middle School for the first two seasons and then Abigail Adams High School beginning the third season . In both settings , his class consists of his daughter and her friends and his history lessons relate to their lives , becoming life lessons for them .

Maya was raised in a single - parent household by her mother Katy ; she is tomboyish , social and street smart , but has a troubled past rooted in the fact that her father Kermit abandoned her and Katy before Maya turned five .

Her relationship with Maya is strained at first , reminiscent to that of Shawn and Chet Hunter from Boy Meets World , but they become much closer after Shawn reveals to Maya in `` Girl Meets Master Plan '' that Maya 's father deserting her family was not Katy 's fault ; Katy maintained the story that she drove him away believing that a girl should think well of her father .

He began writing it in 1953 ; the novel was first published in 1961 . Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century , it uses a distinctive non-chronological third - person omniscient narration , describing events from the points of view of different characters . The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot . </P> <P> The novel is set during World War II , from 1942 to 1944 . It mainly follows the life of Captain John Yossarian , a U.S. Army Air Forces B - 25 bombardier . Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa , in the Mediterranean Sea , west of Italy . The novel looks into the experiences of Yossarian and the other airmen in the camp , who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 2 Style </Li> <Li> 3 Characters </Li> <Li> 4 Influences </Li> <Li> 5 Concept </Li> <Li> 6 Literary allusions </Li> <Li> 7 Historical context </Li> <Li> 8 Explanation of the novel 's title </Li> <Li> 9 Publication and movie rights </Li> <Li> 10 Reception </Li> <Li> 11 Rankings </Li> <Li> 12 Adaptations </Li> <Li> 13 Selected releases </Li> <Li> 14 See also </Li> <Li> 15 References </Li> <Li> 16 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Synopsis ( edit ) </H2> <P> The development of the novel can be split into segments . The first ( chapters 1 -- 11 ) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters , but in a single chronological time in 1944 . The second ( chapters 12 -- 20 ) flashes back to focus primarily on the `` Great Big Siege of Bologna '' before once again jumping to the chronological ' present ' of 1944 in the third part ( chapter 21 -- 25 ) . The fourth ( chapters 26 -- 28 ) flashes back to the origins and growth of Milo 's syndicate , with the fifth part ( chapter 28 -- 32 ) returning again to the narrative present but keeping to the same tone of the previous four . The sixth and final part ( chapter 32 on ) remains in the story 's present , but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general . Previously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events , but in the final section , the events are laid bare . The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village , with the following chapters involving despair ( Doc Daneeka and the Chaplain ) , disappearance in combat ( Orr and Clevinger ) , disappearance caused by the army ( Dunbar ) or death of most of Yossarian 's friends ( Nately , McWatt , Mudd , Kid Sampson , Dobbs , Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe ) , culminating in the unspeakable horrors of Chapter 39 , in particular the rape and murder of Michaela , who represents pure innocence . In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of Snowden are finally revealed . Despite this , the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of Orr 's miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian 's pledge to follow him there . </P> <H2> Style ( edit ) </H2> <P> Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view , so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration , with the new information often completing a joke , the setup of which was told several chapters previously . The narrative 's events are out of sequence , but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events . Specific words , phrases , and questions are also repeated frequently , generally to comic effect . </P> <P> Much of Heller 's prose in Catch - 22 is circular and repetitive , exemplifying in its form the structure of a Catch - 22 . Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions . Heller revels in paradox , for example : `` The Texan turned out to be good - natured , generous and likable . In three days no one could stand him '' , and `` The case against Clevinger was open and shut . The only thing missing was something to charge him with . '' This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book . </P> <P> While a few characters are most prominent , notably Yossarian and the Chaplain , the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any `` minor characters . '' </P> <P> Although its non-chronological structure may at first seem random , Catch 22 is highly structured . It is founded on a structure of free association , ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections . For example , Chapter 1 entitled `` The Texan '' ends with `` everybody but the CID man , who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia . '' Chapter 2 , entitled `` Clevinger '' , begins with `` In a way , the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on . '' The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links . </P> <P> Yossarian comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that `` they '' are `` out to get him . '' Chief among the reasons Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions , Colonel Cathcart increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home ; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised . He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost jaundice . In Yossarian 's words : </P> <Dl> <Dd> The enemy is anybody who 's going to get you killed , no matter which side he 's on , and that includes Colonel Cathcart . And do n't you forget that , because the longer you remember it , the longer you might live . </Dd> </Dl> <P> While the military 's enemies are Germans , none appear in the story as an enemy combatant . This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel , who act as pilots employed by the squadron 's Mess Officer , Milo Minderbinder , to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa . This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine , which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit , quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints . Heller emphasizes the danger of profit seeking by portraying Milo without `` evil intent . '' Milo 's actions are portrayed as the result of greed , not malice . </P> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> Further information : List of Catch - 22 characters <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section is empty . You can help by adding to it . ( November 2016 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Influences ( edit ) </H2> <P> Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age . His experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired Catch - 22 ; Heller later said that he `` never had a bad officer . '' In a 1977 essay on Catch - 22 , Heller stated that the `` antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book '' were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself . Heller 's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism . </P> <P> The influence of the 1950s on Catch - 22 is evident through Heller 's extensive use of anachronism . Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II , Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers ( IBM machines ) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s . Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s : </P> <Ul> <Li> Milo Minderbinder 's maxim `` What 's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country '' alludes to the former president of General Motors Charles Erwin Wilson 's statement before the Senate `` What 's good for General Motors is good for the country . '' </Li> <Li> The question of `` Who promoted Major Major ? '' alludes to Joseph McCarthy 's questioning of the promotion of Major Peress , an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths . </Li> </Ul> <P> Czech writer Arnošt Lustig recounts in his book 3x18 that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written Catch - 22 had he not first read The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek . </P> <P> In 1998 , some critics raised the possibility that Heller 's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein 's 1950 novel , Face of a Hero . Falstein never raised the issue between Catch - 22 's publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel . Heller said that the novel had been influenced by Céline , Waugh and Nabokov . Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors ' experiences , both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II . However , their themes and styles are different . </P> <H2> Concept ( edit ) </H2> <P> Strictly speaking , a `` Catch - 22 '' is `` a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule . '' For example , losing something is typically a conventional problem ; to solve it , one looks for the lost item until one finds it . But if the thing lost is one 's glasses , one can not see to look for them -- a Catch - 22 . The term `` Catch - 22 '' is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no - win or absurd situation . </P> <P> In the book , Catch - 22 is a military rule typifying bureaucratic operation and reasoning . The rule is not stated in a general form , but the principal example in the book fits the definition above : If one is crazy , one does not have to fly missions ; and one must be crazy to fly . But one has to apply to be excused , and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy . As a result , one must continue flying , either not applying to be excused , or applying and being refused . The narrator explains : </P> <P> There was only one catch and that was Catch - 22 , which specified that a concern for one 's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind . Orr was crazy and could be grounded . All he had to do was ask ; and as soon as he did , he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions . Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he did n't , but if he were sane he had to fly them . If he flew them he was crazy and did n't have to , but if he did n't want to he was sane and had to . Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch - 22 and let out a respectful whistle . ( p. 56 , ch. 5 ) </P> <P> Other forms of Catch - 22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions . At one point , victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs ' explanation of one of Catch - 22 's provisions : `` Catch - 22 states that agents enforcing Catch - 22 need not prove that Catch - 22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating . '' Another character explains : `` Catch - 22 says they have a right to do anything we ca n't stop them from doing . '' </P> <P> Yossarian comes to realize that Catch - 22 does not actually exist , but because the powers that be claim it does , and the world believes it does , it nevertheless has potent effects . Indeed , because it does not exist , there is no way it can be repealed , undone , overthrown , or denounced . The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book 's primary motifs . </P> <P> The motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994 's Closing Time , Heller 's sequel to Catch - 22 . This darker , slower - paced , apocalyptic novel explores the pre - and post-war lives of some of the major characters in Catch - 22 , with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer . </P> <H2> Literary allusions ( edit ) </H2> <P> Catch - 22 contains allusions to many works of literature . Howard Jacobson , in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication , wrote that the novel was `` positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature 's opposites -- between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and Céline and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand , and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons ( if Heller had ever heard of the Goons ) . '' One critic argues that it is Kafka 's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel : `` Like Kafka 's heroes , Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare -- in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly . '' </P> <H2> Historical context ( edit ) </H2> <P> The idea for Catch - 22 was based on Joseph Heller 's personal experience in World War II . The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber pilots felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty . Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944 . Heller was able to make it out of the war , but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it . The war experience turned Heller into a `` tortured , funny , deeply peculiar human being '' . </P> <P> After publication in 1961 , Catch - 22 became very popular among teenagers at the time . Catch - 22 seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War . A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch - 22 . The popularity of the book created a cult following , which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States . On October 26 , 1986 , professor and author John W. Aldridge wrote a piece in the New York Times celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of `` Catch - 22 '' . He commented that Heller 's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come : </P> <P> `` The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive . '' </P> <H2> Explanation of the novel 's title ( edit ) </H2> <P> The title is a reference to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical and immoral reasoning . The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in New World Writing as Catch - 18 in 1955 , but Heller 's agent , Candida Donadio , requested that he change the title of the novel , so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel , Leon Uris 's Mila 18 . The number 18 has special meaning in Judaism ( it means Alive in Gematria ; see Chai ) and was relevant to early drafts of the novel which had a somewhat greater Jewish emphasis . </P> <P> The title Catch - 11 was suggested , with the duplicated 1 paralleling the repetition found in a number of character exchanges in the novel , but because of the release of the 1960 movie Ocean 's Eleven , this was also rejected . Catch - 17 was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film Stalag 17 , as was Catch - 14 , apparently because the publisher did not feel that 14 was a `` funny number . '' Eventually , the title came to be Catch - 22 , which , like 11 , has a duplicated digit , with the 2 also referring to a number of déjà vu - like events common in the novel . </P> <H2> Publication and movie rights ( edit ) </H2> <P> Catch - 22 was sold to Simon & Schuster , where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb , who along with Nina Bourne , would edit and oversee the marketing of the book . Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the title along with Peter Schwed and Justin Kaplan . Henry Simon , a vice-president at Simon & Schuster , found it repetitive and offensive . The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions -- he signed for $1,500 . </P> <P> Officially published on 10 October 1961 , the hardcover sold for $5.95 . The book was not a best - seller in hardcover in the United States . Though it sold 12,000 copies by Thanksgiving , it never entered the New York Times Bestseller List . Catch - 22 received good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962 . ( Heller lost out to Walker Percy 's The Moviegoer . ) It went through four printings in hardcover , but only sold well on the East Coast . The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents . </P> <P> Upon publication in Great Britain , the book became the # 1 best - seller . Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to Catch - 22 for $32,000 . Between the paperback 's release in September 1962 and April 1963 , it sold 1.1 million copies . In August 1962 , Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative . There were positive reviews from The Nation ( `` the best novel to come out in years '' ) , the New York Herald Tribune ( `` A wild , moving , shocking , hilarious , raging , exhilarating , giant roller - coaster of a book '' ) and The New York Times ( `` A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights '' ) . On the other hand , The New Yorker ( `` does n't even seem to be written ; instead , it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper '' , `` what remains is a debris of sour jokes '' ) and a second review from the New York Times ( `` repetitive and monotonous . Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest '' ) disliked it . One commentator of Catch - 22 recognized that `` many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it '' The book had a cult following though , especially among teenagers and college students . Heller remarks that in 1962 , after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time , John Chancellor , who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading `` YOSSARIAN LIVES '' . Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building . </P> <P> Although the novel won no awards upon release , it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century . Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military . Since its release in 1961 , the book has sold 10 million copies . </P> <P> Although he continued writing , including a sequel novel Closing Time , Heller 's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of Catch - 22 . When asked by critics why he 'd never managed to write another novel as good as his groundbreaking work , Heller would retort with a smile `` Who has ?

      "context": "Rhine -- Herne canal - wikipedia <H1> Rhine -- Herne canal </H1> Jump to : navigation , search View from the Gasometer Oberhausen <P> The Rhine -- Herne Canal ( German : Rhein - Herne - Kanal ) is a 45.6 - kilometre - long ( 28.3 mi ) transportation canal in the Ruhr area of North Rhine - Westphalia , Germany , with five canal locks . The canal was built over a period of eight years ( 5 April 1906 - 14 July 1914 ) and connects the harbour in Duisburg on the Rhine ( 51 ° 26 ′ 59 '' N 6 ° 46 ′ 1 '' E ﻿ / ﻿ 51.44972 ° N 6.76694 ° E ﻿ / 51.44972 ; 6.76694 ) with the Dortmund - Ems Canal near Henrichenburg ( 51 ° 37 ′ 1 '' N 7 ° 19 ′ 19 '' E ﻿ / ﻿ 51.61694 ° N 7.32194 ° E ﻿ / 51.61694 ; 7.32194 ) , following the valley of the Emscher . It was widened in the 1980s . The Rhein - Herne canal ship was designed specifically for this canal ; normally of about 1300 -- 1350 ton capacity , it has a maximum draft of 2.50 metres ( 8.2 ft ) , a length of approximately 80 metres ( 260 ft ) , and maximum beam of 9.50 metres ( 31.2 ft ) . </P> <P> Originally the Rhine - Herne canal ended in Herne , where it met a branch of the Dortmund - Ems - Kanal running from Henrichenburg to Herne , the intersection situated just above the East Herne lock . </P> <P> After the closure of the last part of the Henrichenburg to Herne canal , the Henrichenburg - Herne section of the Dortmund - Ems was added to the Rhein - Herne Canal . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Water system </Li> <Li> 2 Locks <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Duisburg - Meiderich sluicegate </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Ports <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Duisburg </Li> <Li> 3.2 Oberhausen marina </Li> <Li> 3.3 City port of Essen </Li> <Li> 3.4 City port of Gelsenkirchen </Li> <Li> 3.5 Port Grimberg </Li> <Li> 3.6 Ports Wanne west and Wanne east </Li> <Li> 3.7 City port of Recklinghausen </Li> <Li> 3.8 Port of the Frederick the Great mine </Li> <Li> 3.9 Port of the King Ludwig mine </Li> <Li> 3.10 Port Victor </Li> <Li> 3.11 Port Rütgers </Li> <Li> 3.12 Port Luck </Li> <Li> 3.13 Port Marmorit </Li> <Li> 3.14 Waltrop lock park </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Ecosystem </Li> <Li> 5 Cities </Li> <Li> 6 References and notes </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Water system ( edit ) </H2> <P> The distribution of water in the canal is realised through five pump stations . Located at Duisburg - Meiderich , Oberhausen , Gelsenkirchen , Wanne - Eickel and East Herne , they pump water from the Rhine into the canal at each stage . As well as this , water from the Lippe river to the east is brought in through the Datteln - Hamm Canal . </P> <H2> Locks ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2009 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Duisburg - Meiderich sluicegate ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1980 the current sluicegate was completed , including a 24 - metre - high ( 79 ft ) under-gate and control platform , which has now become a visible yellow landmark in the Ruhr landscape . The intended harbour of the old lock is today underwater and part of the foundations of the canal walls . This harbour was meant to be a possible spot for the eventual significant reconstruction of the lock , but it was never used for this purpose . </P> <P> A possible reconstruction of the sluice gate was commissioned in 1914 with the canal opening . Instead of the old sluice of 165 metres ( 541 ft ) in length and 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in breadth a new sluice chamber with a usable length of 190 metres ( 620 ft ) and a breadth of 12 metres ( 39 ft ) were commissioned , so that bigger ships with lighters ( barges ) as specified in Euro class II can pass through the sluice gates . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Ports ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Duisburg ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Duisburg § Duisburg Port <P> The canal begins in Duisburg along with the Schifffahrtskanal ; connected to land by three bays of the Kanalhafen , and to the rest of the world via the Rhine . </P> <P> The Rhine - Herne Canal headquarters is in the Meiderich district of Duisburg , it serves as the water and shipping management canal and its locks from Essen to Herne . From here maintenance and repair work are organised and performed . </P> <H3> Oberhausen marina ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Oberhausen marina is a yacht port opened in 2004 in close proximity to the CentrO shopping centre . The port has a water depth of 2.5 metres ( 8.2 ft ) and over 13 bridges . Also at the Oberhausen marina are the attractions Sealife Oberhausen and Oberhausen Modellbahn World . </P> <H3> City port of Essen ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Stadthafen Essen ( City port of Essen ) is the youngest port on the Rhine -- Herne Canal opened in 1934 by the city of Essen , and operated since 1987 by Stadtwerke Essen . </P> <P> The port consists of a doubled sided canal side quay together with a harbour port at right angles onto the canal , which together form a water area of 63,000 square metres ( 680,000 sq ft ) with associated dock - land of 300,000 square metres ( 3,200,000 sq ft ) The dock handles bulk goods such as solid mineral fuels , petroleum and chemical products , stone , earth and iron and steel as well as recyclable materials , and is an important transhipment point . </P> <H3> City port of Gelsenkirchen ( edit ) </H3> The port of Gelsenkirchen <P> The port of the city of Gelsenkirchen ( Stadthafen Gelsenkirchen ) was opened in July 1914 and is the oldest port on the Rhine -- Herne Canal . </P> <P> The port has two docks branched from the canal situated just east of the lock at Gelsenkirchen and has a water surface of 117,800 square metres ( 1,268,000 sq ft ) . The industrial port is ~ 900 by 60 metres ( 2,950 by 200 ft ) and the trading port ~ 500 by 75 metres ( 1,640 by 246 ft ) . A private railway of length 18.4 kilometres ( 11.4 mi ) is operated which is linked to the tracks of the Deutsche Bahn </P> <P> Formerly the port dealt mainly with coal and mining products , now the port is a major hub for petroleum products and second - largest inland port for cereals in North Rhine - Westphalia . It is operated by the Gelsenkirchener Logistik - , Hafen - und Servicegesellschaft ( Gelsenkirchener logistics , harbour and service company . ) a subsidiary of Stadtwerke Gelsenkirchen . </P> <H3> Port Grimberg ( edit ) </H3> The port at Grimberg <P> Hafen Grimberg ( Port Grimberg ) is on the south canal bank in Gelsenkirchen , near the city boundary to Herne . It was named after the nearby Castle Grimberg , of which today only the foundations remain . </P> <P> Built in 1914 by the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG ( GBAG ) to provide a link to the GBAG mines of Rheinelbe , Alma and Pluto as well as supplying the ironworks of ' Schalker group ' with imported ore . Around the same time , and up to 1929 the industrial railway of Erzbahn was built , serving the Schalker and Bochum group iron and steelworks . Between 1937 and 1968 Grimberg harbour was one of the major ports on the canal . In 1968 steel production at the southern end of the Erzbahn at Bochum ended , in 1982 the Schalker works closed - with this the use of the port for transport of iron ore ended . Such was the emphasis on iron ore that much of the port now stands empty , part of it nowadays is used for the processing of recycled materials for the building industry , as well as a storage facility . </P> <H3> Ports Wanne west and Wanne east ( edit ) </H3> See also : Wanne - Herner Eisenbahn und Hafen <P> Like many other the port of Westhafen Wanne ( Wanne west harbour ) was originally built for the mutual benefit of the mines and canal , with a railway connecting the two . Today the quayside still has coal traffic and associated industries . </P> <P> The docks of the port at Wanner West were filled in to make room for the Güterverkehrszentrum Emscher - a logistics ( road , rail and river ) centre working in association with other companies . The Wanne - Herner Eisenbahn und Hafen GmbH ( WHE ) operates both the remaining canal side docks and the associated railway . </P> <P> The Osthafen Wanne ( Port Wanne east ) are also operated by the WHE ; the ports and rail link serves a major scrap metal works . </P> <H3> City port of Recklinghausen ( edit ) </H3> Recklinghausen port ( 2008 ) grain terminal <P> Originally the city of Recklinghausen had no access to the canal ; through an exchange of land with the city of Herne the city gained access to the canal . </P> <P> In recent decades , the port was abandoned . However through the actions of the company ' United Mills ' grain shipments were made using a mobile crane . Since late 2007 , the port has expanded and a grain loading plant installed : new mills and silos have been installed . </P> <H3> Port of the Frederick the Great mine ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hafen der Zeche Friedrich der Große ( Frederick the Great mine port ) is directly south of the Port of the King Ludwig mine , as of 2009 the port is the site of an industrial estate named the Industriegebeit Friedrich der Große . The harbour which is cut parallel to the canal is still extant , but without fixed infrastructure , cranes etc . </P> <H3> Port of the King Ludwig mine ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Hafen der Zeche König Ludwig served the coal transported from , and deliveries to the former King Ludwig mine . </P> <P> It is located at kilometer 38 of the canal , just upstream of the Herne Ost lock , on the north bank opposite the Hafen der Zeche Friedrich der Große ( Frederick the Great mine port ) . </P> <P> The 6,900 - square - metre ( 1.7 - acre ) harbor basin was built from 1897 to 1898 when the section of the canal ( the then branch channel of the Dortmund - Ems Canal ) , was already flooded . In 1912 , at the colliery port handled 360,096 tonnes of goods . In 1913 the docks expanded . Because of mining subsidence by 1954 the quaywall had to be increased by 2.50 metres ( 8.2 ft ) . </P> <P> In the 1980s , it was leased to Automobil - und Motorbootsport - Club Castrop - Rauxel e . V ( The car and motorboat club of Castrop - Rauxel ) and is used from recreational boating , being no longer used by Ruhrkohle AG , and contains many small boats . The former mine railway , which starts at the harbour is now a walking and biking trail . </P> <H3> Port Victor ( edit ) </H3> Looking east - northeast towards Port Victor on the Rhine - Herne Canal <P> The Victor Harbor ( Hafen Victor ) was created to serve the former colliery ' Victor ' which finished all operations in 1973 . The port is in the city of Castrop - Rauxel in the vicinity of Schloss Bladenhorst ( Castle ' Blade Horst ' ) , about 2 kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) upstream from the Hafen der Zeche Friedrich der Große also on the south bank . Today the port still handles coal with the help of two gantry cranes . </P> <H3> Port Rütgers ( edit ) </H3> Looking east towards Port Rütgers <P> Port Rütgers ( Hafen Rütgers ) is the port of Rütgers Chemicals ( founded by Julius Rütgers ) and is about 500 metres ( 1,600 ft ) upstream of the Port Victor on the east side of the canal after the canal makes a slight bend to the north . The main product dealt with here is pitch obtained from coal tar from the refining of coal . The port has a Pneumatic barrier . </P> <H3> Port Luck ( edit ) </H3> Port Luck <P> Port Luck ( Hafen Luck ) belongs to the construction and building materials company Luck located on the east bank , a little more than 2 kilometres upstream of Rütgers Chemicals . </P> <H3> Port Marmorit ( edit ) </H3> Port marmorit with its single fixed crane <P> Port Marmorit ( Hafen Marmorit ) is the port of cement and lime mortar manufacturer and distributor Marmorit Knauf GmbH located north of a disused canal side channel and just north of the bridge carrying Wartburgstraße ( Wartburgstreet ) . The actual facility consists of little more than a pier . </P> <H3> Waltrop lock park ( edit ) </H3> <P> Here after 45.6 kilometres ( 28.3 mi ) ends ( or begins ) the Rhine -- Herne Canal , which meets the Dortmund - Ems canal ( at the 14.7 - kilometre mark ) near the old Henrichenburg boat lift ( replaced in 1962 by a newer lock , and in 1989 by a new larger lock ) . The terminal is used as a mooring for pleasure craft . It forms part of the Waltrop lock park . </P> <H2> Ecosystem ( edit ) </H2> <P> Fish that inhabit the canal include European eel , European carp , zander , carp bream , common roach and common rudd , as well as the less common pike and rainbow trout . </P> <H2> Cities ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Duisburg </Li> <Li> Oberhausen </Li> <Li> Essen </Li> <Li> Bottrop </Li> <Li> Gelsenkirchen </Li> <Li> Herne </Li> <Li> Recklinghausen </Li> <Li> Castrop - Rauxel </Li> <Li> Waltrop </Li> <Li> Datteln </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Rhein - Herne - Kanal . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References and notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Route A42 of the Federal Motorways now partly follows the route of the disused canal , ie . the section from the port at the Friedrich der Große coal mine to Bahnhofstraße in Herne . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Stadthafen Essen route-industriekultur.de </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hafen Gelsenkirchen hafen-ge.de </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Stadthafen Gelsenkirchen route-industriekultur.de </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hafen Grimberg und Erzbahn route-industrielkultur.de </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Westhafen Wanne is more clearly on the north bank of the canal , with Osthafen Wanne almost directly opposite on the south bank .

Known as the `` Garden of the Gulf '' , the island is located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence north of Nova Scotia and east of New Brunswick , with which it forms the Northumberland Strait . </P> <P> PEI consists of the capital city Charlottetown , as well as urban towns Cornwall and Stratford and a developing urban fringe . A smaller urban area surrounds Summerside Harbor , situated on the southern shore 40 kilometers west of Charlottetown Harbor , and consists primarily of the city of Summerside . As with all natural harbors on the island , Charlottetown and Summerside harbors are created by rias . ( See also a list of communities in Prince Edward Island . ) </P> <P> The island 's landscape is pastoral : rolling hills , pristine forests , white sand beaches , ocean coves and the famous red soil have given Prince Edward Island a reputation as a province of outstanding natural beauty . A number of laws have been passed by the provincial government to attempt to preserve the landscape through regulation , although the lack of consistent enforcement and absence of province - wide zoning and land - use planning has resulted in some aesthetically displeasing development in recent years . </P> <P> The island 's lush landscape has had a strong bearing not only on its economy but also its culture . Author Lucy Maud Montgomery drew inspiration from the land during the late Victorian Era for the setting of her classic novel Anne of Green Gables . Today , many of the same qualities that Montgomery and others found in the Island are enjoyed by tourists who visit during all seasons . They enjoy a variety of leisure activities , including beaches , various golf courses , eco-tourism adventures , and simply touring the countryside and enjoying cultural events in local communities around the island . </P> <P> The highest point of land is located at Springton in Queens County ( 152 metres or 499 feet above sea level ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Communities </Li> <Li> 2 Coastline </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Communities ( edit ) </H2> <P> The smaller rural communities as well as the towns and villages throughout the province proudly retain a slower - paced , old world flavor , something that factors heavily into Prince Edward Island 's popularity as a destination for relaxation . Most rural communities on Prince Edward Island are based on small - scale agriculture , given that the size of farm properties is quite small when compared with other areas in Canada . There is an increasing amount of industrial farming as older farm properties are consolidated and modernized . </P> <H2> Coastline ( edit ) </H2> <P> The coastline of the island consists of a combination of long beaches , dunes , red sandstone cliffs , salt water marshes and numerous bays and harbours . The beaches , dunes and sandstone cliffs consist of sedimentary rock and other material with a high iron concentration which oxidizes upon exposure to the air . The geological properties of a white silica sand found at Basin Head are unique in the province ; the sand grains cause a scrubbing noise as they rub against each other when walked on . Large dune fields on the north shore can be found on barrier islands at the entrances to various bays and harbours . The magnificent sand dunes at Greenwich are of particular significance . The shifting , parabolic dune system is home to a variety of birds and rare plants and is also a site of significant archeological interest . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Geography of Canada portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of parks in Prince Edward Island </Li> <Li> List of islands of Prince Edward Island </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H2> External links ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> Geography of the provinces and territories of Canada </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> National </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Geography of Canada </Li> <Li> Centre of Canada </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Provinces </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> British Columbia </Li> <Li> Alberta </Li> <Li> Saskatchewan </Li> <Li> Manitoba </Li> <Li> Ontario </Li> <Li> Quebec </Li> <Li> New Brunswick </Li> <Li> Nova Scotia </Li> <Li> Prince Edward Island </Li> <Li> Newfoundland and Labrador </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Territories </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Yukon </Li> <Li> Northwest Territories </Li> <Li> Nunavut </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> See also </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Regions of Canada </Li> <Li> Islands </Li> <Li> Rivers </Li> <Li> Lakes </Li> <Li> Mountains </Li> <Li> National Parks </Li> <Li> Volcanoes </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Portal </Li> <Li> WikiProject </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> Retrieved from `` https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Geography_of_Prince_Edward_Island&oldid=835998214 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Geography of Prince Edward Island </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles with peacock terms from August 2017 </Li> <Li> All articles with peacock terms </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Contents </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> Français </Li> </Ul> Edit links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 12 April 2018 , at 01 : 54 . </Li> <Li> Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike License ; additional terms may apply .

( June 2015 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> Schematic two - dimensional cross-sectional view of glycogen : A core protein of glycogenin is surrounded by branches of glucose units . The entire globular granule may contain around 30,000 glucose units . A view of the atomic structure of a single branched strand of glucose units in a glycogen molecule . Glycogen ( black granules ) in spermatozoa of a flatworm ; transmission electron microscopy , scale : 0.3 μm <P> Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in humans , animals , fungi , and bacteria . The polysaccharide structure represents the main storage form of glucose in the body . </P> <P> Glycogen functions as one of two forms of long - term energy reserves , with the other form being triglyceride stores in adipose tissue ( i.e. , body fat ) . In humans , glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the liver and skeletal muscle . In the liver , glycogen can make up from 5 -- 6 % of the organ 's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70 kg can store roughly 100 -- 120 grams of glycogen . In skeletal muscle , glycogen is found in a low concentration ( 1 -- 2 % of the muscle mass ) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg can store roughly 400 grams of glycogen . The amount of glycogen stored in the body -- particularly within the muscles and liver -- mostly depends on physical training , basal metabolic rate , and eating habits . Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells , including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain . The uterus also stores glycogen during pregnancy to nourish the embryo . </P> <P> Approximately 4 grams of glucose are present in the blood of humans at all times ; in fasted individuals , blood glucose is maintained constant at this level at the expense of glycogen stores in the liver and skeletal muscle . Glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve as a form of energy storage for the muscle itself ; however , the breakdown of muscle glycogen impedes muscle glucose uptake , thereby increasing the amount of blood glucose available for use in other tissues . Liver glycogen stores serve as a store of glucose for use throughout the body , particularly the central nervous system . The human brain consumes approximately 60 % of blood glucose in fasted , sedentary individuals . </P> <P> Glycogen is the analogue of starch , a glucose polymer that functions as energy storage in plants . It has a structure similar to amylopectin ( a component of starch ) , but is more extensively branched and compact than starch . Both are white powders in their dry state . Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol / cytoplasm in many cell types , and plays an important role in the glucose cycle . Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose , but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides ( lipids ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Structure </Li> <Li> 2 Functions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Liver </Li> <Li> 2.2 Muscle </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 History </Li> <Li> 4 Metabolism <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Synthesis </Li> <Li> 4.2 Breakdown </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Clinical relevance <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Disorders of glycogen metabolism </Li> <Li> 5.2 Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Structure ( edit ) </H2> 1 , 4 - α - glycosidic linkages in the glycogen oligomer 1 , 4 - α - glycosidic and 1 , 6 - glycosidic linkages in the glycogen oligomer <P> Glycogen is a branched biopolymer consisting of linear chains of glucose residues with an average chain length of approximately 8 -- 12 glucose units . Glucose units are linked together linearly by α ( 1 → 4 ) glycosidic bonds from one glucose to the next . Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α ( 1 → 6 ) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain . </P> <P> Due to the way glycogen is synthesised , every glycogen granule has at its core a glycogenin protein . </P> <P> Glycogen in muscle , liver , and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form , composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45 millimoles ( 18 mg ) of potassium per gram of glycogen . </P> <H2> Functions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Liver ( edit ) </H3> <P> As a meal containing carbohydrates or protein is eaten and digested , blood glucose levels rise , and the pancreas secretes insulin . Blood glucose from the portal vein enters liver cells ( hepatocytes ) . Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several enzymes , including glycogen synthase . Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful . In this postprandial or `` fed '' state , the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases . </P> <P> After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall , insulin secretion is reduced , and glycogen synthesis stops . When it is needed for energy , glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose . Glycogen phosphorylase is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown . For the next 8 -- 12 hours , glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel . </P> <P> Glucagon , another hormone produced by the pancreas , in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin . In response to insulin levels being below normal ( when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range ) , glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both glycogenolysis ( the breakdown of glycogen ) and gluconeogenesis ( the production of glucose from other sources ) . </P> <H3> Muscle ( edit ) </H3> <P> Muscle cell glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells . Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally , as well . As muscle cells lack glucose - 6 - phosphatase , which is required to pass glucose into the blood , the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells . This is in contrast to liver cells , which , on demand , readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Glycogen was discovered by Claude Bernard . His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a `` ferment '' in the liver . By 1857 , he described the isolation of a substance he called `` la matière glycogène '' , or `` sugar - forming substance '' . Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver , A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen . The empirical formula for glycogen of ( C ) was established by Kekule in 1858 . </P> <H2> Metabolism ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Synthesis ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Glycogenesis <P> Glycogen synthesis is , unlike its breakdown , endergonic -- it requires the input of energy . Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate ( UTP ) , which reacts with glucose - 1 - phosphate , forming UDP - glucose , in a reaction catalysed by UTP -- glucose - 1 - phosphate uridylyltransferase . Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP - glucose initially by the protein glycogenin , which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen , since glycogenin is a homodimer . After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue , the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP - glucose , adding α ( 1 → 4 ) - bonded glucose . The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C - 6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule . The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues , and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains . </P> <H3> Breakdown ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Glycogenolysis <P> Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to produce monomers of glucose - 1 - phosphate : </P> <P> In vivo , phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose - 1 - phosphate is usually greater than 100 . Glucose - 1 - phosphate is then converted to glucose 6 - phosphate ( G6P ) by phosphoglucomutase . A special debranching enzyme is needed to remove the α ( 1 - 6 ) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer . The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates : </P> <Ul> <Li> G6P can continue on the glycolysis pathway and be used as fuel . </Li> <Li> G6P can enter the pentose phosphate pathway via the enzyme glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase to produce NADPH and 5 - carbon sugars . </Li> <Li> In the liver and kidney , G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6 - phosphatase . This is the final step in the gluconeogenesis pathway . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Clinical relevance ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Disorders of glycogen metabolism ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most common disease in which glycogen metabolism becomes abnormal is diabetes , in which , because of abnormal amounts of insulin , liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted . Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism , as well . </P> <P> In hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin , liver glycogen levels are high , but the high insulin levels prevent the glycogenolysis necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels . Glucagon is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia . </P> <P> Various inborn errors of metabolism are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown . These are collectively referred to as glycogen storage diseases . </P> <H3> Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise ( edit ) </H3> See also : Central nervous system fatigue <P> Long - distance athletes , such as marathon runners , cross-country skiers , and cyclists , often experience glycogen depletion , where almost all of the athlete 's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption . This phenomenon is referred to as `` hitting the wall '' . </P> <P> Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways . First , during exercise , carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose ( high glycemic index ) are ingested continuously . The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35 % of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80 % of maximum . Second , through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens ( e.g. fasting low - intensity endurance training ) , the body can condition type I muscle fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel , sparing carbohydrate use from all sources . Third , by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet , the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores . This process is known as carbohydrate loading . In general , glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion . </P> <P> When experiencing glycogen debt , athletes often experience extreme fatigue to the point that it is difficult to move . As a reference , the very best professional cyclists in the world will usually finish a 4 - to 5 - hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies . </P> <P> When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and caffeine following exhaustive exercise , their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly ; however , the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a clinically significant effect on glycogen repletion has not been established . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Chitin </Li> <Li> Peptidoglycan </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ William D.

Lord Darlington has died a broken man , his reputation destroyed after he was exposed as a Nazi sympathizer , and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired United States Congressman , Mr Jack Lewis . Stevens is granted permission to borrow his Daimler , and he sets off to the West Country to meet Miss Kenton . </P> <P> The film flashes back to Kenton 's arrival as housekeeper in the 1930s . The ever - efficient Stevens managed the household well , taking great pride in his profession , and his dedication was fully displayed when , while his father lay dying , he steadfastly continued his duties . Miss Kenton , too , proved to be a valuable servant , and she was equally efficient and strong - willed , but also warmer and less repressed . Relations between the two eventually warmed , and it became clear she had feelings for him , yet despite their proximity and shared purpose , Stevens ' detachment remained unchanged ; his first and only loyalty was to his service as Lord Darlington 's butler . One time , Miss Kenton embarrassed Stevens by catching him reading a romance novel ; Stevens told Miss Kenton has was reading it only to improve his vocabulary . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Darlington Hall was regularly frequented by politicians of the interwar period , and many of Lord Darlington 's guests were like - minded , fascist - sympathizing British and European aristocrats , with the exception of the more pragmatic Congressman Lewis , who did not share the `` noble instincts '' of Lord Darlington and his guests . Lewis informed the `` gentleman politicians '' in his midst that `` Europe has become the arena of Realpolitik '' and warned them they were `` headed for disaster . '' </P> <P> Darlington later met Prime Minister Chamberlain and the German Ambassador , and used his influence to try to broker a policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany , based on his belief that Germany had been unfairly treated by the Treaty of Versailles following the First World War and only desires peace . In the midst of these events - and after overhearing Sir Geoffrey Wren praising Nazi racial laws - Darlington suddenly requested that two newly - appointed German - Jewish maids , both sisters and refugees , should be dismissed , despite being Stevens ' mild protest that the sisters were good workers . Nevertheless , Stevens carried out Lord Darlington 's command , despite a horrified Miss Kenton threatening to resign in protest . Miss Kenton later confided in Stevens she had no family and nowhere to go to should she leave Darlington Hall , and was ashamed to not follow up on her threat to resign . </P> <P> Lord Darlington 's godson , journalist Reginald Cardinal , was appalled by the nature of the secret meetings in Darlington Hall ; concurring with Congressman Lewis ' earlier protestations , Cardinal told Stevens that Lord Darlington was a pawn , being used by the Nazis . Despite Cardinal 's indignation , Stevens did not denounce or criticise his master . Later , Lord Darlington expressed regret for having dismissed Ilsa and Irma , the two German - Jewish maids . He asked Stevens to locate them and Stevens enquired Miss Kenton as to the maids ' whereabouts . ( It is revealed the sisters were returned to Germany ; their ultimate fate is unknown . ) </P> <P> Eventually , Miss Kenton formed a relationship with a former co-worker , Tom Benn , who proposed marriage and asked Miss Kenton to move away with him to run a coastal boarding house . Miss Kenton mentioned this proposal to Stevens , in effect offering him an ultimatum , but Stevens would not admit his feelings , offering Miss Kenton only his congratulations . Miss Kenton left Darlington Hall prior to the outbreak of the Second World War . Before Miss Kenton 's departure , Stevens found her crying in frustration , but the only response he could muster was to call her attention to a neglected domestic task . </P> <P> En route to meeting Miss Kenton in 1958 , when asked by locals about his former employer , Stevens at first denies having served or even met Lord Darlington , but later admits to having served and respected him . He meets Miss Kenton ( now Mrs Benn ) , and they reminisce . Stevens mentions in conversation that Lord Darlington 's godson , Reginald Cardinal , was killed in the war . He also says Lord Darlington died from a broken heart - after the war , Lord Darlington sued a newspaper for libel , losing the suit and his reputation in the process . Stevens reveals that in his declining years , Lord Darlington at times failed to recognise Stevens and carried on conversations with no one else in the room . </P> <P> Miss Kenton declines Stevens ' offer to return to Darlington Hall , wishing instead to remain near her pregnant daughter . After the meeting , Miss Kenton is emotional , while Stevens is still unable to demonstrate any feeling . Back in Darlington Hall , Lewis asks Stevens if he remembers much of the old days , to which Stevens replies that he was too busy serving . A pigeon then becomes trapped in the hall , and is eventually freed by the two men , leaving both Stevens and Darlington Hall far behind . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Anthony Hopkins as Mr. James Stevens </Li> <Li> Emma Thompson as Miss Sarah `` Sally '' Kenton ( later Mrs Benn after marriage ) </Li> <Li> James Fox as Lord Darlington </Li> <Li> Christopher Reeve as Congressman Jack Lewis </Li> <Li> Peter Vaughan as Mr William Stevens ( `` Mr Stevens , Sr '' ) </Li> <Li> Hugh Grant as Reginald Cardinal ( Lord Darlington 's godson ) </Li> <Li> John Haycraft as Auctioneer </Li> <Li> Caroline Hunt as Landlady </Li> <Li> Michael Lonsdale as Dupont d'Ivry </Li> <Li> Paula Jacobs as Mrs Mortimer </Li> <Li> Ben Chaplin as Charlie </Li> <Li> Steve Dibben as George ( footman no . 2 ) </Li> <Li> Abigail Harrison as Housemaid </Li> <Li> Rupert Vansittart as Sir Geoffrey Wren </Li> <Li> Patrick Godfrey as Spencer </Li> <Li> Peter Halliday as Canon Tufnell </Li> <Li> Peter Cellier as Sir Leonard Bax </Li> <Li> Frank Shelley as Prime Minister </Li> <Li> Peter Eyre as Lord Halifax </Li> <Li> Terence Bayler as Trimmer </Li> <Li> Hugh Sweetman as Scullery Boy </Li> <Li> Tony Aitken as Postmaster </Li> <Li> Emma Lewis as Elsa </Li> <Li> Joanna Joseph as Irma </Li> <Li> Tim Pigott - Smith as Tom Benn </Li> <Li> Lena Headey as Lizzie </Li> <Li> Pip Torrens as Doctor Carlisle </Li> <Li> Brigitte Kahn as German Baroness </Li> <Li> Wolf Kahler as German Ambassador </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> A film adaptation of the novel was originally planned to be directed by Mike Nichols from a script by Harold Pinter . Some of Pinter 's script was used in the film , but , while Pinter was paid for his work , he asked to have his name removed from the credits , in keeping with his contract . Christopher C. Hudgins observes : `` During our 1994 interview , Pinter told ( Steven H . ) Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for The Handmaid 's Tale , which he has decided not to publish . When his script for The Remains of the Day was radically revised by the James Ivory - Ismail Merchant partnership , he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits '' ( 125 ) . </P> <P> Though no longer the director , Nichols remained associated with the project as one of the producers of the Merchant Ivory film . </P> <H3> Settings ( edit ) </H3> Music Room of Powderham Castle in 1983 <P> A number of English country estates were used as locations for the film , partly owing to the persuasive power of Ismail Merchant , who was able to cajole permission for the production to borrow houses not normally open to the public . Among them were Dyrham Park for the exterior of the house and the driveway , Powderham Castle ( staircase , hall , music room , bedroom ; used for the aqua - turquoise stairway scenes ) , Corsham Court ( library and dining room ) and Badminton House ( servants ' quarters , conservatory , entrance hall ) . Luciana Arrighi , the production designer , scouted most of these locations . Scenes were also shot in Weston - super-Mare , which stood in for Clevedon . The pub where Mr Stevens stays is the Hop Pole in Limpley Stoke ; the shop featured is also in Limpley Stoke . The pub where Miss Kenton and Mr Benn meet is the George Inn , Norton St Philip . </P> <H3> Characters ( edit ) </H3> <P> The character of Sir Geoffrey Wren is based loosely on that of Sir Oswald Mosley , a British fascist active in the 1930s . Wren is depicted as a strict vegetarian . </P> <P> Edward Wood , 1st Earl of Halifax also appears in the film . Lord Darlington tells Stevens that Halifax approved of the polish on the silver , and Halifax himself later appears when Darlington meets secretly with the German Ambassador and his aides at night . Halifax was a chief architect of the British policy of appeasement from 1937 to 1939 . </P> <P> The character of Congressman Jack Lewis in the film is a composite of two separate American characters in Kazuo Ishiguro 's novel : Congressman Lewis ( who attends the pre-WW2 conference in Darlington Hall ) , and Mr Farraday , who succeeds Lord Darlington as master of Darlington Hall . </P> <H2> Score ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> The Remains of the Day </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Film score by Richard Robbins </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Length </Th> <Td> 49 : 26 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Professional ratings </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> Review scores </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Source </Th> <Th> Rating </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Entertainment Weekly </Td> <Td> A link </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The original score is composed by Richard Robbins .

Its consensus states : `` Smart , elegant , and blessed with impeccable performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson , The Remains of the Day is a Merchant - Ivory classic . '' Roger Ebert particularly praised the film and called it `` a subtle , thoughtful movie . '' In his review for The Washington Post , Desson Howe gave the film a favorable review , and said of it `` Put Anthony Hopkins , Emma Thompson and James Fox together and you can expect sterling performances , '' praising their work in the film . Vincent Canby of The New York Times said , in another favorable review , `` Here 's a film for adults . It 's also about time to recognize that Mr Ivory is one of our finest directors , something that critics tend to overlook because most of his films have been literary adaptations .

' ... Pinter 's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer , but that in such a case he could withdraw his name ( which is exactly the case with ( the film ) The Remains of the Day - he had insisted on this clause since the bad experience with revisions made to his Handmaid 's Tale script ) ; he has never been given any reason as to why another writer was brought in '' ( Gale 352 ) . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hudgins adds : `` We did not see Pinter 's name up in lights when Lyne 's Lolita finally made its appearance in 1998 .

It is usually prepared for Easter in Bulgaria , and mostly for every major holiday ( Christmas , Easter , New Year 's Day , Pentecost ) in Romania and Moldova . </P> <P> The dessert is also known as tsoureki ( Greek : τσουρέκι ) , شوريك ( Arabic ) , panarët ( Arbërisht ) , choreg or chorek ( Armenian : չորեկ ) , çörək ( Azerbaijani ) , or çörek ( Turkish ) . It is a sweet , egg - enriched bread , which is rooted in the cuisines of Western and Central Asia . Such rich brioche - like breads are also traditional in many other countries , such as Hungary and the Czech Republic . Examples of similar breads from other cultures include badnji kruh in Croatian cuisine , folar de páscoa in Portuguese cuisine , brioche in French cuisine , kulich in Russian cuisine , panettone in Italian cuisine , and challah in Jewish cuisine . </P> <P> Cozonac is a sweet bread , into which milk , yeast , eggs , sugar , butter , and other ingredients are mixed together and allowed to rise before baking . In Bulgaria , the kozunak is prepared by adding lemon zest to the dough mixture , just as the Romanian version . The Italian Panettone is very similar to the basic cozonac , the most visible difference being their shapes . </P> <P> In Romania , the recipes for trimmings differ rather significantly between regions . The dough is essentially similar throughout the country ; a plain sweet bread made from flour , eggs , milk , butter , sugar and salt . Depending on the region , one may add to it any of the following : raisins , rahat , grated orange or lemon zest , walnuts or hazelnuts , and vanilla or rum flavor . Cozonac may be sprinkled with poppy seeds on top . Other styles dictate the use of a filling , usually a ground walnut mixture with ground poppy seeds , cocoa powder , rum essence , or raisins . The dough is rolled flat with a pin , the filling is spread and the whole is rolled back into a shape vaguely resembling a pinwheel . In the baked product , the filling forms a swirl adding to the character of the bread . </P> <P> It was the sweet chosen to represent Romania in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union , on Europe Day 2006 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Origins </Li> <Li> 2 See also </Li> <Li> 3 Notes and references </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Origins ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is possible that the first cozonac has been made in Ancient Egypt . Perhaps it was sweetened with honey and filled with seeds . The Greeks took from the Egyptians their interest in cuisine , the yeast , and the leavened doughs . Certainly the Greeks have eaten cozonac . They made it with honey , raisins and walnuts . The Greek cozonac is called plakoús ( πλακούς ) . Yeast and implicitly leavened breads , such as cozonac , were `` stolen '' from the Greeks by the Romans , where they added dried fruits to the cozonac . At first there were only two varieties called libum and placenta . Libum was a small cake , used as an offering to the gods . Later appeared versions were also consumed by people , not only by the gods . Placenta , more elaborate , is a cozonac made from cheese , raisins and peanuts , which was served with a sweet wine . Although , they took the ready - made yeast from the Greeks and the Egyptians , the Romans were the ones who discovered all the possibilities offered by the yeast added to doughs , thus becoming true masters of pastry . In the Middle Ages , European bakers often made cozonac with dried fruits , because they lasted longer . </P> <P> In Great Britain , the first recipe of cozonac appears in a cookbook in 1718 , with the recommendation to be baked in long and narrow forms , a recommendation that remains valid nowadays . The French people , those who in the 19th century added the third kind of meal , the dessert , are those who put forward the cozonac , more than others . </P> <P> Today , this dessert with a long history is prepared mainly in the southeastern European countries , especially in Romania , Moldova and Bulgaria , where it is considered a traditional food . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul>

      "question": "do you cut cards to the left or right",
      "context": "Cut ( cards ) - wikipedia <H1> Cut ( cards ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Not to be confused with cut card </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> In many card games , to cut the cards ( or to cut the deck ) is a procedure used just prior to the cards being dealt to the players . </P> <P> A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled , the dealer sets the cards face - down on the table near the player designated to make the cut , typically the player to the dealer 's right . That player initiates a cut of the deck by taking a contiguous range of cards off the top of the deck and placing it face - down on the table closer to the dealer ; the dealer completes the cut by taking the original bottom portion of the deck and placing it on top of the just - moved cards . Once the cut is complete , the dealer picks up the deck , straightens or `` squares '' it , and deals the cards . </P> <P> Rules of procedure or etiquette may vary concerning who makes the cut , the minimum or maximum number of cards which may be cut off the top , whether the dealer or the cutter restacks the cards , whether a cut card is employed , and whether a cut is mandatory . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Purpose </Li> <Li> 2 Etiquette </Li> <Li> 3 Scarne 's cut </Li> <Li> 4 Multiple cuts </Li> <Li> 5 False cut </Li> <Li> 6 As a game </Li> <Li> 7 As a joke </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Purpose ( edit ) </H2> <P> The practice of cutting is primarily a method of reducing the likelihood of someone cheating by manipulating the order of cards to gain advantage . Even if the dealer ( or the shuffler , if he is not the dealer ) does not plan on cheating , cutting will prevent suspicions , thus many rules require it . Some players also consider the cut to be lucky . </P> <H2> Etiquette ( edit ) </H2> <P> The contiguous section may also be taken from the middle of the deck . This is called `` Scarne 's cut '' , though in some settings this is considered poor etiquette or against the rules . A cut involving a very small number of cards , such as taking only the top card ( or some cards from the bottom ) as a cut , is often acceptable according to rules . The same is true when a player takes every top card save for one on the cut . </P> <P> During informal card games , the dealer is typically not required to offer the cut , and even if offered , the designated player can decline the request . On the other hand , any player may specifically request to cut the cards before they are dealt . If a cut is requested by a player , it must be granted by the dealer . </P> <P> In formal player dealt settings , such as in a casino or during a tournament , an offer to cut the deck is mandatory and the designated player must perform the cut , generally by inserting a cut card ( a plastic card about the size of a playing card , usually solid - colored ) into the deck ; the dealer then makes the actual cut at that point in the deck . When the dealer is not a player ( i.e. a casino employee ) , the cut is mandatory and is usually performed by the dealer . In this instance , the deck is cut onto the aforementioned cut card , and the cut completed ; this prevents players from seeing the bottom card of the deck . </P> <P> A cut should always be completed with one hand to limit possibility of a false cut . </P> <H2> Scarne 's cut ( edit ) </H2> <P> Scarne 's cut was developed by John Scarne during World War II to help protect servicemen against cheating by unscrupulous dealers . First one pulls out a portion of the middle of the stack and places it back on top of the deck ; one then performs a regular cut described earlier . </P> <H2> Multiple cuts ( edit ) </H2> <P> It can be demonstrated that multiple top - to - bottom ( non-Scarne's ) cuts are equivalent to some single cut . In fact , knowing the size of the deck and the size of the cuts , the formula for the composite single cut is given as the sum of the sizes of the cuts modulo the size of the deck . For example , in a 10 card deck , if a 7 card cut and a 4 card cut are made , that is , 7 cards are moved from the top of the deck to the bottom and then the resulting top 4 cards are also moved to the bottom , then those two consecutive cuts are equivalent to a cut the size of ( 7 + 4 = 11 ( mod 10 ) ) = 1 . The deck will be in the order ( 2 , 3 , ... , 10 , 1 ) . </P> <H2> False cut ( edit ) </H2> <P> A false cut is a move used either in magic , or for cheating when playing card games . It appears to be a real cut , but leaves the deck in the same order as when it began . More sophisticated versions may make specific desired changes to the deck 's order , while still appearing to be an innocuous normal cut . </P> <P> There are many ways to accomplish a false cut , involving misdirection or using complex moves to conceal the real result . </P> <H2> As a game ( edit ) </H2> <P> Cutting cards is usually a prelude to a game , but it can be a game unto itself . Each player , in turn , removes a selection of cards from the top and reveals the bottom card to all the players , and then replaces the cards in the original position . Whoever has revealed the highest ( or sometimes lowest ) card is the winner . This is often used in an informal setting , much like flipping coins ; it is also sometimes used to determine who will play first in a card game . </P> <H2> As a joke ( edit ) </H2> <P> The command to `` cut the cards '' , following by someone literally chopping the deck in half with an axe , is a none - too - subtle gag that has been used many times in popular media , going back to at least the vaudeville days . Examples include Harpo Marx in Horse Feathers , Curly Howard in Ants in the Pantry , and Bugs Bunny in Bugs Bunny Rides Again . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Shorter Oxford English Dictionary ( 5th ed . ) .

The corollary states that the United States will intervene in conflicts between European countries and Latin American countries to enforce legitimate claims of the European powers , rather than having the Europeans press their claims directly . </P> <P> Roosevelt tied his policy to the Monroe Doctrine , and it was also consistent with his foreign policy included in his Big Stick Diplomacy . Roosevelt stated that in keeping with the Monroe Doctrine , the United States was justified in exercising `` international police power '' to put an end to chronic unrest or wrongdoing in the Western Hemisphere . While the Monroe Doctrine had sought to prevent European intervention , the Roosevelt Corollary was used to justify US intervention throughout the hemisphere . In 1934 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt renounced interventionism and established his Good Neighbor policy for the Western Hemisphere . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Use <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Shift to the `` Good Neighbor '' policy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Criticism </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Use ( edit ) </H2> See also : Overseas interventions of the United States <P> The Roosevelt Corollary was an addition to the Monroe Doctrine ; however , it could be seen as a departure . While the Monroe Doctrine said European countries should stay out of Latin America , the Roosevelt Corollary took this further to say he had the right to exercise military force in Latin American countries to keep European countries out . Historian Walter LaFeber wrote </P> <P> ( Roosevelt ) essentially turns the Monroe Doctrine on its head and toes says the Europeans should stay out , but the United States has the right , under the doctrine , to go in to exercise police power to keep the Europeans out of the way . </P> <P> It is a very nice twist on the Monroe Doctrine , and of course , it becomes very , very important because over the next 15 to 20 years , the United States will move into Latin America about a dozen times with military force , to the point where the United States Marines become known in the area as `` State Department Troops '' because they are always moving in to protect State Department interests and State Department policy in the Caribbean . So what Roosevelt does here , by redefining the Monroe Doctrine , turns out to be very historical , and it leads the United States into a period of confrontation with peoples in the Caribbean and Central America , that was an imperative part of American imperialism . </P> <P> Roosevelt first used the Corollary to act in the Dominican Republic in 1904 , which at the time was severely indebted and becoming a failed state . The United States dispatched two warships and demanded the customs house be turned over to U.S. negotiators , who then used a percentage of the proceeds to pay foreign creditors . This model -- in which United States advisors worked to stabilize Latin American nations through temporary protectorates , staving off European action -- became known as `` dollar diplomacy '' . The Dominican experiment , like most other `` dollar diplomacy '' arrangements , proved temporary and untenable , and the United States launched a larger military intervention in 1912 . </P> <P> U.S. Presidents also cited the Roosevelt Corollary as justification for U.S. intervention in Cuba ( 1906 -- 1909 ) , Nicaragua ( 1909 -- 1910 , 1912 -- 1925 and 1926 -- 1933 ) , Haiti ( 1915 -- 1934 ) , and the Dominican Republic ( 1916 -- 1924 ) . </P> <H3> Shift to the `` Good Neighbor '' policy ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Good Neighbor policy <P> In 1928 , under President Calvin Coolidge , the Clark Memorandum -- often seen as a partial repudiation of the Roosevelt Corollary -- stated that the U.S. did not have the right to intervene when there was a threat by European powers . Herbert Hoover also helped move the U.S. away from the imperialist tendencies of the Roosevelt Corollary by going on good - will tours , withdrawing troops from Nicaragua and Haiti , and abstaining from intervening in the internal affairs of neighboring countries . In 1934 , Franklin D. Roosevelt further renounced interventionism and established his `` Good Neighbor policy '' that led to the annulment of the Platt Amendment by the Treaty of Relations with Cuba in 1934 , and the negotiation of compensation for Mexico 's nationalization of foreign - owned oil assets in 1938 . Indeed , leaving unchallenged the emergence of dictatorships like that of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba , Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in the Dominican Republic , Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua , and François Duvalier in Haiti were each considered to be `` Frankenstein dictators '' due to the mishandlings of the American occupations in the countries . </P> <P> The era of the Good Neighbor Policy ended with the ramp - up of the Cold War in 1945 , as the United States felt there was a greater need to protect the western hemisphere from Soviet influence . In 1954 , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles invoked the Monroe Doctrine and the Roosevelt Corollary at the Tenth Pan-American Conference in Caracas , denouncing the intervention of Soviet Communism in Guatemala . This was used to justify Operation PBSUCCESS that deposed the democratically elected President Jacobo Árbenz and installed the military regime of Carlos Castillo Armas , the first in a series of military dictators in the country . </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> The argument made by Mitchener and Weidenmier in 2006 in support of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine has been criticized on the grounds that it `` represent ( s ) the one - sided approach that some scholars bring to the study of imperialistic and hegemonic interventions and also highlight how arguments for the general utility of imperialism are increasingly made and accepted . '' Christopher Coyne and Stephen Davies argue that a foreign policy modeled on the Roosevelt Corollary leads to negative consequences both in national security terms and in terms of its effect on domestic politics . </P> <P> Critics , such as Noam Chomsky , have argued that the Roosevelt Corollary was merely a more explicit imperialist threat , building on the Monroe Doctrine , indicating that the U.S. would intervene not only in defense of South American states in the face of European imperialism , but would also use its muscle to obtain concessions and privileges for American corporations . Serge Ricard of the University of Paris goes even further , stating that the Roosevelt Corollary was not merely an addendum to the earlier Monroe Doctrine , through which the U.S. pledged to protect the Americas from European imperialist interventions . Rather , the Roosevelt Corollary was `` an entirely new diplomatic tenet that epitomized his ' big stick ' approach to foreign policy . '' In other words , while the Monroe Doctrine sought to bar entry to the European empires , the Roosevelt Corollary announced the United States intention to take their place . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> International relations portal </Li> <Li> Government of the United States portal </Li> <Li> United States portal </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Roosevelt Corollary </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> History of the United States ( 1865 -- 1918 ) </Li> <Li> United States territorial acquisitions </Li> <Li> New Imperialism </Li> <Li> Dollar Diplomacy </Li> <Li> Big Stick ideology </Li> <Li> Drago Doctrine </Li> <Li> Bush Doctrine </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Theodore Roosevelt , 26th President .

Scott has sometimes been a disappointment to Lee over the years but these days , Lee could n't be more proud of Scott and the way he turned his life around . In 1964 , as the painful memories of her past marriage to notorious Phil Brewer subsided , Jessie Brewer began to go out on tentative dates with her lawyer , Lee Baldwin . A lifelong bachelor and recovering alcoholic , Lee was a fixture on the seventh floor of General Hospital where he volunteered as an addiction counselor . </P> <P> When Jessie discovered she was pregnant by Phil after Phil left town , Lee offered to marry Jessie in order to give her baby a name . Once Jessie 's divorce from Phil was finalized , she would become Mrs. Lee Baldwin . But Phil found out about Jessie 's pregnancy before they could wed and returned to Port Charles . Phil plead for one month 's time to make it up to Jessie , but Jessie was afraid that if she left Lee , he 'd be devastated and return to drinking . Jessie went forth with her plans to marry Lee , but on the eve of their wedding , Jessie went into labor ! Phil was thrilled , since the divorce was n't finalized , and the baby would be born with his name ! Jessie gave birth to a beautiful daughter , Nancy Brewer , and Lee gallantly released Jessie from the `` burden '' of their engagement . Unfortunately , Nancy Brewer died of a heart condition in July 1966 . </P> <P> Lee was delighted by the arrival of nurse Meg Bentley that same year . Meg was a widow with a young son Scotty and teenage stepdaughter Brooke . Lee was forced to maintain a platonic relationship with Meg , since she was already engaged to Dr. Noel Clinton . Meg was devastated when Noel announced that he was leaving her for her stepdaughter Brooke ! Meg turned to Lee , who helped her through the shocking crisis . The situation was difficult for young Scotty Bentley , who lost both his sister and the man he hoped would become his father , when Noel and Brooke ran off to get married . Lee became a surrogate father to Scotty , and Meg happily wed Lee in late 1966 . Lee adopted Scotty shortly thereafter . Lee defended Jessie when she faced murder charges over her dead husband , Dr. John Prentice . Lee lost the case , and Jessie was sent to jail , but an eleventh hour confession by her stepdaughter Polly set her free . </P> <P> In 1969 , Lee and Meg 's marriage began to come apart when Meg 's old nursing school friend , Iris Fairchild , came to Port Charles and used alcohol to solve her life 's problems . Lee intervened and counseled her , giving her a job as his secretary and a reason to go on . Meg grew jealous of Lee 's friendship with Iris , and accused them of having an affair . Lee and Meg separated for a while over Meg 's unfounded accusations , but came together again when Lee donated his kidney to save Scotty 's life . </P> <P> The following year , Brooke 's marriage to Noel had fallen apart and Brooke returned to live with Meg and Lee . Meg was diagnosed with breast cancer , and after a radical mastectomy , Meg 's insecurities about her appearance were magnified by the presence of sexy Brooke . Meg suffered a nervous breakdown from her jealousy and depression , and Lee was regrettably forced to institutionalize his wife . By 1971 , Lee was thrilled to welcome Meg back from the mental institution , supposedly recovered from her mental breakdown . Now , Meg suffered from a severe case of hypertension . Dr. Lesley Williams , a strikingly beautiful doctor , was assigned to her case at General Hospital . The jealous Meg began to suspect -- wrongly -- that Lesley was trying to work her way into Lee 's bed ! During an argument with Lee , Meg suddenly died of a fatal stroke . Lee was devastated , but remained strong for Scotty . </P> <P> Lee defended Jessie against murder charges again in 1974 , when Jessie stood accused of her ex-husband Dr. Phil Brewer 's murder . Jessie saddened Lee when she refused to cooperate in her own defense . Lee urged Jessie to fight the charges , letting his emotions run away with him and kissing her passionately ! Lee proved Jessie 's innocence , but they could n't rekindle their old relationship . To Scotty 's delight , Lee Baldwin found a soulmate in adoption agent Caroline Chandler . After a marriage and a short honeymoon , the newlyweds returned to town to face the disastrous news that Caroline 's son , Bobby , an energetic med student , was suffering from an incurable case of Melenkoff 's disease . Miraculously , Bobby 's certain fate was reversed when Steve discovered that Bobby 's fatal diagnosis was wrong ! Rejoicing from the welcome news , Lee and Caroline joined Bobby in New York where he received treatment . </P> <P> Lee Baldwin returned to Port Charles in 1977 after his wife died in an accident . Lee found comfort in long , warm and platonic evenings with Dr. Gail Adamson. Lee and Gail were good company for each other . Sensing his devastation , Gail secretly contacted Scotty Baldwin , Lee 's stepson , urging the young law student to get in touch with the only father he 'd ever known . Scotty had left Port Charles several years earlier and was now living in New York 's Greenwich Village . Gail 's mission worked when Scotty showed up in town . She smiled with satisfaction as father and son reunited . Scotty , agreeing to join the `` establishment '' , accepted a clerking job at General Hospital , where he met and became instantly captivated by young Laura Webber . </P> <P> In the spring of 1979 , Scotty kept assuring Laura that he was doing everything in his power to bring a June wedding about , but she lost confidence that they would ever be together . Disillusioned , Laura returned her ring and set out to make new friends . Laura 's disregard for his feelings sent Scotty into a tailspin . In despair , Scotty turned to drink . Thankfully , Lee , a recovering alcoholic , pulled his son out of the trap . Lee and Gail were married early in 1979 , followed by Laura and Scotty a short time later . Gail and Lee were constantly wrapped up in Scotty 's personal troubles . They stood by him through all the tumultuous twists and turns in Scotty 's marriage to Laura which included her rape at the campus disco by Luke Spencer . </P> <H3> 1980 -- 2013 ( edit ) </H3> <P> For much of 1980 , Lee and Gail tried to help Laura and Scotty repair their damaged marriage which became strained because of Laura 's rape . Scotty eventually found proof of who had raped Laura and showed up at Luke 's wedding to Jennifer Smith , and punched Luke , sending him flying overboard the Smith yacht . Laura found Luke and disappeared from Port Charles , leaving Scotty very bitter towards life . He soon disappeared from Port Charles , leaving only a letter for Laura , denouncing her as a slut . Because he blamed her for Scotty 's departure , Lee became antagonistic towards Laura , especially when they found themselves face to face at ELQ where Laura worked as a receptionist and Lee aided Edward Quartermaine in his legal issues . After Laura spent another summer on the run with Luke , she returned , determined to marry Scotty , and found him in Mexico where he promised to give her a divorce so she could marry Luke . The divorce papers ended up in Lee 's hands , and he burned them , embittered over Laura 's betrayal of his son . Gail feared that Lee would turn back to the bottle , but eventually Lee confessed what he had done and made amends with Laura , attending the wedding with no animosity from either Luke or Laura . When Scotty caught the bridal bouquet at the wedding and announced that he was contesting the divorce , Lee and Gail tried to talk some sense into him but were horrified to find out that he had returned to town a very embittered man . When Laura disappeared soon afterwards and was presumed dead , Lee and Gail mourned her but were relieved to find out that Scotty ( who had shared a plane ride with her that very night ) had nothing to do with her disappearance . </P> <P> At Scotty 's encouragement , Lee ran for Mayor in 1983 , and his opponent was none other than Luke Spencer , the man who ruined Scotty and Laura 's marriage ! Scotty was managing Lee 's campaign and using smear tactics to discredit Luke . Scotty even threatened to expose Luke 's sister 's past as a prostitute to get him to drop out of the race ! When Lee found out what Scotty was up to , Lee fired Scotty and Scotty left town . Luke 's campaign manager D.L. Brock used Lee 's alcoholism against him but Luke demanded that he not pull stunts like what Scotty had done . Luke won the election but after Laura was revealed to be alive , he resigned and Lee took over , resigning at the end of 1985 and leaving town with Gail to travel in early 1986 . In 1989 , Gail visited Port Charles alone , informing Scott ( who had returned ) that Lee was busy with work . The next year , Lee paid a visit with Gail and was shocked to find him in bed with Tracy Quartermaine . </P> <P> They returned to town for good in 1992 and supported Scotty when he married Dominique Taub who was dying . They were present at his wedding to Katherine Bell in late 1983 which was broken off when Lucy Coe revealed lies about Katherine 's past . Scott left town shortly afterwards . Lee and Gail were surprised to learn they were grandparents , when it was revealed in 1994 that Scott fathered high school graduate Karen Wexler with his secretary Rhonda Wexler when he was a law student . The very same year , Lee defended old friend Edward Quartermaine on the charges of murdering his own illegitimate son Bradley Ward who had actually been killed by their old business acquaintance Jack Boland . </P> <P> After several ups and downs with Scotty , Lee and Gail were thrilled when he returned to Port Charles in 1997 with his young daughter Serena . Dr. Julie Devlin called on Lee 's legal services in 1998 when she stood accused of the General Homicide serial killings . Julie 's murder trial began and Lee set out to make Dr. Eve Lambert look like the guilty party . Lee was successful in his defense of Julie , who was acquitted of all the charges against her . The killer was still at large , but the authorities now had a clue to go on as someone who resembled Eve was caught on tape by the surveillance camera on the roof of the hospital . At that same time , a woman wearing a very Eve - like wig was seen looking at herself in the mirror . When the woman turned around , it was revealed that Julie was the General Homicide killer ! </P> <P> As it turned out , Julie was really being controlled by evil Dr. Greg Cooper , and was doing his bidding . When Julie was finally caught , Lee Baldwin was appointed as her legal guardian , and Gail helped see to it that Julie was committed to Ferncliff psychiatric facility to get the therapy she needed . Chris and Julie schemed to have Lee replaced as Julie 's guardian to further their plan to get Julie acquitted of the murder charges and released from Ferncliff . </P> <P> Lee worried his loved ones in 1999 when he suffered a Pulmonary Embolism that nearly claimed his life , but with the love and support of his family rallying around him , Lee pulled through and is back to being a vital part of Port Charles . For months , DV Bordisso had made life a living hell for Scott and Lucy Coe . As it turned out , DV claimed to be Scott 's biological father and he wanted to get revenge on Scott for what his mother , Meg , had done to him before Scott was even born ! Scott , Lucy , Kevin , Eve and Victor all teamed up to beat DV at his own game and emerged victorious in the end . DV , however , managed to frame Scott for attempted murder , but an innocent Scott beat the charges . Scott faced some inner demons upon learning that DV was his biological father , but Lee helped Scott to see that no matter what Scott 's biology , he was Lee 's son , and was a good person . </P> <P> Lee and Gail were devastated by the July 2003 death of their eldest granddaughter Karen , when she was hit by a car . Though Lee and Gail mourned her death , they took comfort in the fact that Karen 's blood helped save Lucy 's life . Lila Quartermaine quietly died in her sleep on the evening of Tuesday , July 13 , 2004 , and Lee and Gail paid their respects to the Quartermaines at the funeral that Friday . The sources of joy for Lee are his beloved wife Gail and granddaughter , Serena . Highly respected by everyone in the community , Lee always comes down on the right side of the law . </P> <P> In May 2013 , Scott opted not to invite Lee , Gail , & Serena to his & Laura 's wedding , but rather keep it small and intimate .

      "context": "Pay Commission - Wikipedia <H1> Pay Commission </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> Pay Commission is set up by Government of India , and gives its recommendations regarding changes in salary structure of its employees . Since India 's Independence , seven pay commissions have been set up on a regular basis to review and make recommendations on the work and pay structure of all civil and military divisions of the Government of India . Headquartered in Delhi , the Commission is given 18 months from date of its constitution to make its recommendations . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 First Pay Commission </Li> <Li> 2 Second Pay Commission </Li> <Li> 3 Third Pay Commission <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Third Pay Commission and the Armed forces </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Fourth Pay Commission <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Fourth Pay Commission and the Armed forces </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Fifth Pay Commission <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Financial Impact of Fifth pay commission </Li> <Li> 5.2 Other recommendations </Li> <Li> 5.3 Criticisms by World Bank </Li> <Li> 5.4 Fifth Pay Commission and the Armed forces <Ul> <Li> 5.4. 1 Terms of Reference </Li> <Li> 5.4. 2 Lateral Transfer </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Sixth Pay Commission </Li> <Li> 7 Seventh Pay Commission <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Composition </Li> <Li> 7.2 SC constitute a new Pay commission for trial court judges </Li> <Li> 7.3 Seventh Pay Commission and the Armed forces </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> First pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first pay commission was established on January , 1946 and it submitted its report in May , 1947 to the interim government of India . It was under the chairmanship of Srinivasa Varadachariar . The mandate of 1st ( nine members ) was to examining and recommending emolument structure of Civilian employees . </P> <P> Post War Pay Committee for the armed Forces </P> <P> Armed forces emoluments structure was determined not by the 1st Central Pay Commission ( CPC ) but by a Departmental Committee which had service members . The task of this committee was to make recommendations `` in the structure of emoluments and benefits of service personnel in the light of the recommendations made by the pay commission for civilian employees '' . The First Pay Committee , set up after the 1st pay Commission , was called `` The Post War Pay Committee for the armed Forces '' . The New Pay Code effective from 1 July 1947 was based on the recommendations of this Committee . The pensionary benefits were examined by separate committee called `` Armed Forces Pension Revision Committee ( 1949 -- 50 ) '' . </P> <H2> Second pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The second pay commission was set up in August 1957 , 10 years after independence and it gave its report after two years . The recommendations of the second pay commission had a financial impact of ₹ 39.6 crore . The chairman of the second pay commission was Jagannath Das. The second pay commission reiterated the principle on which the salaries have to be determined . It stated that the pay structure and the working conditions of the government employee should be crafted in a way so as to ensure efficient functioning of the system by recruiting persons with a minimum qualification . </P> <P> Raghuramiah Committee </P> <P> The Departmental Pay Committee , set up after the 2nd pay Commission , was called , the Raghuramiah Committee ( 1960 ) , which had service representatives . It examined armed forces emoluments and made recommendations . </P> <H2> Third pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The third pay commission set up in April 1970 gave its report in March 1973 i.e. it took almost 3 years to submit the report , and created proposals that cost the government ₹ 144 crore . The chairman was Raghubir Dayal . The third pay commission ( 3CPC ) added three very important concepts of inclusiveness , comprehensibility , and adequacy for pay structure to be sound in nature . The third pay commission went beyond the idea of minimum subsistence that was adopted by the first pay commission . The commission report says that the true test which the government should adopt is to know whether the services are attractive and it retains the people it needs and if these persons are satisfied by that they are getting paid . </P> <H3> Third pay Commission and the armed forces ( edit ) </H3> <P> The 3CPC was the first Pay Commission without military member . Its `` Terms of Reference '' however included `` examination of the structure of emoluments , the retirement benefits and terms and conditions of the Defence Forces personnel '' . The Commission , established ' relativity ' of Defence Forces officers and Indian Police Service ( IPS ) officers , whose wages till for similar years of service were less than that of Armed Forces officers with similar years of service , noted that `` the relativity '' with IPS was `` only a working method of devising scales of pay for the service officers which did not mean that the functional role of the two services were similar '' . The Commission , ambiguously `` qualified this statement by mentioning that the job profile of IPS officers was the closest civilian analogue vis - à - vis infantry officers and that ' a working relationship did exist between the two organizations ' '' . While establishing some sort of parity , and relativity with IPS , the Commission , without an explanation , noted `` that the pay structure of the Indian Administrative Service with its long pay scales was particularly unsuitable for service officers '' , even though the pay structures of armed forces and Indian Civil Service had been , as a matter of established practice , at par . </P> <P> It controversially recommended that military pension be de-linked from military service conditions to conform to civil pensions . On the basis of the 3 CPC recommendations Indira Gandhi , Prime Minister in the Indian National Congress ( INC ) government , took an `` ex-parte '' decision and terminated One Rank , One Pension ( OROP ) , the basis of military pensions till then . </P> <P> In 1973 , the Government , implemented the following changes in pension and service conditions of the Armed Forces : ( 1 ) Increased the pension of civilians , who retired at 58 , by 20 percent , from 30 to 50 percent ; ( 2 ) reduced the pension of soldier , Non Commissioned Officers ( NCOs ) , and Junior commissioned Officers ( JCOs ) , by 20 percent , from 70 to 50 percent of basic pay , with the caveat that for full pension the minimum service was 33 years ; ( 3 ) an exception was made for the armed forces , the mandatory service for full pension was reduced to 25 year . But as soldiers in 1973 retired after 15 years service , at the age of 33 - 36 , they got less than 30 percent of the pay as pension ; ( 4 ) soldiers pension was thus decreased not by 20 percent but 40 percent from 70 to 30 percent . The government in addition to down grading military pensions down graded the status of soldier by equating `` infantry soldier with less than three years ' service '' with a `` semi-skilled / unskilled labour '' . These decisions were based on the recommendation , and endorsement of KB Lall , Defence Secretary . The decision was announced two months after Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw , the victor of the 1971 war , retired from service . The reason for depressing the armed Forces pensions given by the government was to ensure ' equivalence ' of Armed Forces pensions with civilians . </P> <P> The reduction in armed Forces pension , and down grading its status immediately following the decisive Bangladesh war , was , not unexpectedly , unpopular with the armed Forces , and has since become a cause of persistent grievance , and distrust . Conflating civil and military pensions , and reduction of Armed forces Pension , by the Indira Gandhi Government , has been invoked to rally Armed Forces Veterans , most recently during the OROP protests . </P> <H2> Fourth pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> Constituted in June 1983 , its report was given in three phases within four years and the financial burden to the government was ₹ 1282 crore . This commission has been set up on dated 18.3. 1987 , Gazette of India ( Extra ordinary ) Notification No 91 dated 18.3. 1987 , The chairman of fourth pay commission was PN Singhal . </P> <H3> Fourth pay Commission and the armed forces ( edit ) </H3> <P> Indian National Congress ( I ) Government , headed by Rajiv Gandhi , in the wake of the 4th CPC to implemented concept of ' Rank Pay ' for armed forces officer . Rank Pay affected all officers ranks from second lieutenant to brigadier in the army , and equivalent ranks in the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy . The ' rank pay ' , which varied from 200 to 1200 , was not an additional pay , but amount deducted from their pay grade . This ended long established err Military Indian Police service equations . Police Officers , and officers from other AIS officers , with 14 years of service , who were formerly in the same pay grade as majors , with 14 years service , were equated to Brigadiers , on the basis of the new pay grades . Maj General Satbir Singh an expert on Police - military rank structures and pay grades , called rank pay , `` rarest of rare fraud , perjury and Injustice to the defence forces '' . </P> <P> He explained , `` How could it be allowed that the first military rank of Second Lieutenant along with two promotional ranks of Lieutenant and Captain were all clubbed with the first civilian rank ? '' . Similarly at the level of major `` rank pay ' had the effect of promoting civilian pay grades equal to major till the 3 CPC , to that of Colonels . '' The rank pay became an issue of considerable resentment in the armed forces , and cause of general distrust of the pay commissions , and the Congress I Government . Eventually , Maj AK Dhanapalan , a retired major , litigates ' rank Pay ' . After protracted legal struggle high court , despite many appeals , in a landmark decision declares the ' rank pay ' concept illegal . In its judgment the SC notes that the ' rank pay ' was wrongly deducted from basic pay and ordered re-fixation of pay `` with effect from '' and not `` as on '' 1 January 1986 . </P> <H2> Fifth pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The notification for setting up the Fifth CPC was issued on 9 April 1994 , but started functioning only on 2 May 1994 , with the assumption of charge by the Member Secretary . The chairman of fifth pay commission was Justice S. Ratnavel Pandian . the members were : Suresh Tendulkar , Professor Delhi school of Economics ; and M.K Kaw , Indian Administrative Service . In comparison , First CPC had nine members including military members , the second had six members including a military member , the 3 CPC and 4 CPC had five , but no military member . The fifth had three members , but no military member . The first had no member secretary , just a secretary . After the 1 CPC all pay commissions have had a member secretary , and invariably from the IAS . </P> <P> The 5 CPC report , a massive tome , had nine part in 172 chapters . It took three years with a sanctioned staff 107 , which ballooned to 141 , to prepare the report . By way of comparison , 4 CPC took 209 bureaucrat Accounts Service , Indian Revenue Service , Indian Economic Service , Central Secretariat Service , Border Security Force , Geological Survey of India , Central Public Works Department and National Informatics Centre . It cost ₹ 17,000 crore . </P> <P> Part VI of report dealt with pensions and retirement benefits for civilian ; Part VII dealt with pay scales and allowances of Armed Forces personnel . Part IX is the concluding part of the Report . </P> <H3> Financial impact of Fifth pay Commission ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the implementation of the Fifth Pay commission a huge burden was taken up by the central government . It declared hike in salary of about 3.3 million central government employees . Further , it also insisted on pay revision at the state government level . The Fifth pay commission disturbed the financial situation of both the Central and the State Governments and led to a hue and cry after its implementation . The Central government 's wage bill before the implementation of the commission 's recommendations was 218.85 billion in 1996 - 1997 which also included pension dues , and by 1999 it shot up by about 99 % and the burden on the exchequer was about to ₹ 43,568 crore in 1999 - 2000 . With regard to the state government the bill went up by 74 % . The state governments which paid about Rs 515.48 billion in 1997 as salaries , had to pay Rs 898.13 billion in 1999 as salaries . This clearly indicates the burden on the state and the central government . Many economists say that about 90 % of the revenue of the state went in as salaries . 13 states of India were not in a position to pay salaries to its employees due to the hike and hence the central government 's help was sought . </P> <H3> Other recommendations ( edit ) </H3> <P> One of its recommendations was to slash government workforce by about 30 % . It also recommended to reduce the number of pay scale from 51 to 34 and to not recruit to about 3 , 50,000 vacant position in the government . None of these recommendations were implemented . </P> <H3> Criticisms by World Bank ( edit ) </H3> <P> The World Bank criticized the Fifth Pay Commission , stating that the Fifth Pay Commission is the ' single largest adverse shock ' to the public finance of the nation . It also said that the number of employees of the government was ' not unduly ' large , but there was a ' pronounced imbalance ' in the skills . It noted that about 93 % of the employees were of 3rd or 4th grade . </P> <H3> Fifth pay Commission and the armed forces ( edit ) </H3> Terms of Reference ( edit ) <P> The 4CPC , for unknown reasons , had no separate TORs for the Armed Forces . The 5 CPC , however , for the first time was asked to examine the terms and conditions of the Armed Forces , and make suggestions for what is `` considered desirable and feasible '' . Thus , the pay commission noted ambiguously that `` even their recommendations with regard to changes in the structure of emoluments including death cum gratuity in respect of Armed Forces Personnel had to be made with due regard to the terms and conditions of their service '' </P> Lateral transfer ( edit ) <P> The 5 CPC , in its report submitted in January 1997 , recommended increase in posts for Armed Forces personnel in Group C and D in Central Armed Police Forces ( CAPFs ) from 10 to 25percent . For Short Service Commissioned Officers , on completion of their military service , 5 CPC recommended earmarking 25 percent officer 's post in the CAPFs . These recommendationsby the pay Commission were intended to reduce the defence pension bill ; save on training and recruitment costs ; provide trained manpower to government departments ; and provide soldiers a second career after their term of military engagement . </P> <P> These recommendations of the Pay Commission were , however , mostly ignored by the Janata Dal ( United Front ) , and BJP Government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee that followed . Mulayam Singh Yadav , Defence Minister ( 1 June 1996 -- 19 March 1998 ) , Indrajit Gupta ( Communist Party of India - United Front ) , Home Minister ( 29 June 1996 -- 19 March 1998 ) , and LK Advani ( BJP ) , Home Minister ( 19 March 1998 -- 22 May 2004 ) did little to implement these recommendations . The problem festered , and the pension bill ballooned . </P> <H2> Sixth pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Sixth Central Pay Commission <P> In July 2006 , the Cabinet approved setting up of the sixth pay commission . This commission has been set up under Justice B.N. Srikrishna with a timeframe of 18 months . The cost of hikes in salaries is anticipated to be about ₹ 20,000 crore for a total of 5.5 million government employees as per media speculation on the 6th Pay Commission , the report of which is expected to be handed over in late March / early April 2008 . The employees had threatened to go on a nationwide strike if the government failed to hike their salaries . Reasons for the demand of hikes include rising inflation and rising pay in the private sector due to the forces of Globalization . The Class 1 officers in India are grossly underpaid with an IAS officer with 25 years of work experience earning just Rs. 55,000 as his take home pay . Pay arrears are due from January 2006 till September 2008 . Almost all the Government employees received 40 % of the pay arrears in 2008 and balance 60 % arrears ( as promised by Government ) has also been credited in Government employees account in 2009 . The Sixth Pay Commission mainly focused on removing ambiguity in respect of various pay scales and mainly focused on reducing number of pay scales and bring the idea of pay bands . It recommended for removal of Group - D cadre . </P> <H2> Seventh pay Commission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Government of India has initiated the process to constitute the 7th Central Pay Commission along with finalisation of its Terms of Reference , the composition and the possible timeframe for submission of its Report .

Its recommendations are likely to be implemented with effect from 1 January 2016 . Justice A.K Mathur will be heading the Seventh Pay Commission , announcement of which was done on 4 February 2014 . On 29 June 2016 , Government accepted the recommendation of 7th Pay Commission Report with meager increase in salary of 14 % after six month of intense evaluation and successive discussions . The Finance Minister of India claimed it historical increase of salaries due to little knowledge of Sixth Pay Commission . </P> <H3> Composition ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Designation </Th> <Th> Role in Commission </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ashok Kumar Mathur </Td> <Td> Retired Judge , Supreme Court and Retired Chairman , Armed Forces Tribunal </Td> <Td> Chairman </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Vivek Rae </Td> <Td> Retd .

They alleged that this would lead an inherent bias in the commission 's recommendations towards IAS officers . </P> <P> On 9 November 2017 , the government raised the maximum amount that a central government employee can borrow from the government to Rs 25 lakh for new construction / purchase of new house / flat </P> Earlier this limit was only Rs 7.50 lakh . This move is going to benefit about 50 lakh central government employees all over India . <P> The employee can borrow up to 34 months of the basic pay to a maximum of Rs 25 lakh , or cost of the house / flat , or the amount according to repaying capacity , whichever is the least . </P> If both spouses are central government employees , they can take Housing Building Advance ( HBA ) either jointly , or separately . Also , the rate of Interest on HBA will be only 8.50 % at simple interest . <H3> SC constitute a new pay Commission for trial court judges ( edit ) </H3> <P> The chief justice and other supreme court and high court judges got a threefold salary hike in the sixth pay commission however the trial court judges were paid low and a bench comprising Chief Justice KG Balakrishnan and Justices P Sathasivam and JM Panchal constituted a new pay commission for the trial court judges headed by retired Madras High Court judge , Justice E Padmanabhan for recommendation of revision of about 14000 trial court judges . This order from the SC came because of a petition filed by All India Judges Association , which stated that the first judicial commission which was headed by Justice Jagannatha Shetty said that there should be an upward revision of salaries of lower court judges in proportion to the hike to the judges of high court and Supreme Court . It also sought direction from the court to the centre for setting up a committee `` forthwith appoint a committee of one or more persons to look into the matter '' relating the salary of officers in the lower judiciary . </P> <P> On 19 November 2015 , the 7th Central Pay Commission recommended 23.55 % hike in pay and allowances which will be implemented from 1 January 2016 .

The recommendations will be effected from 1 January 2016 with arrears to be paid in the financial year 2016 - 17 itself unlike previously , when arrears were paid in the following financial year . Also this time , employees will had to wait only 6 months for the CPC 's recommendations to be implemented as compared to 19 months for the 5th CPC and 32 months for the 6th except for autonomous organizations like CSIR , ICAR , ICMR etc. under various ministries . </P> <H3> Seventh pay Commission and the armed forces ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 7th Central Pay Commission ( CPC ) and Defence Forces <P> The recommendation of the 7CPC affecting the armed forces are a cause of profound unease and resentment in the Armed Forces , especially , 7CPC recommendation on separate ' Pay Matrices ' , and allowance system for the armed forces and defence civilians , and police , and other civil servants . While 7CPC provides for mandated timescale promotions to from Defence civilians from audit and account services , police , and other officers at regular intervals of 4 , 9 , 13 , 14 , and 16 years of service ; it does not do so armed forces officers . The orders implemented by the government on the basis of 7 CPC recommendation , despite armed forces advise and concerns , make time scale police officers and defence civilians , with lesser service and experience , senior to armed forces officers , and potentially in command of armed forces officers of equal or more seniority . For instance , Wing Commanders of the Air Force , commander of the navy , and Lt colonel of the army , with 13 years of service , according to MOD implementation tables , will be subordinate in ' level ' , rank , pay scale , and organizational hierarchy than police officers , auditors , accountants , with equal or even lesser service. MOD implementation order has created an invidious situation for armed forces officers when serving alongside defence civilians and police officer . According to the MOD orders a police officer and Defence Accounts officer with 14 years service will be at higher level than the naval officer in command of INS Vikramaditya , India 's Aircraft carrier , a highly selective rank and appointment , with some 20 years of service . </P> <P> In March 2016 , eighteen former heads of the Armed forces , including General Ved Prakash Malik , former Chief of Army Staff , and Admiral Arun Prakash , former Chief of naval staff , send a joint letter to Narendra Modi , the Prime Minister conveying their distress and alarm on the flawed approach and contentious recommendations of the 7CPC . The representations by former Chiefs , and the Chiefs of Staff , to the MOD , the PM , other bureaucratic bodies reviewing the 7CPC recommendations , are in vain . On 25 July 2016 , without addressing or taking into account the key concerns of the armed forces , the Government issued instructions implementing 7CPC 's `` general recommendations on pay without any material alteration '' including separate `` Pay Matrices '' ( for civilians ) and the armed forces . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> One Rank , One Pension </Li> <Li> Rank Pay </Li> <Li> 7th Central Pay Commission ( CPC ) and Defence Forces </Li> <Li> Special Duty Allowance ( SDA ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` About us '' .

Since the mid-1980s Roland was involved in Atlanta 's underground music scene making demos and performing . He also worked at Real 2 Reel Studios in Stockbridge , which was owned by bassist Will Turpin 's father , Bill Turpin . Roland 's duties were producing , mixing and engineering for local Atlanta artists . He recorded his demos and released an independent solo album Ed - E Roland in 1991 . </P> <P> Roland recruited keyboard player and backing vocalist Christopher Dykes , drummer Tony Caporale , and bassist Skip Godwin to play live in clubs and showcase for A / R personnel from various record companies . At this time the group was simply known as `` Ed - E '' . They played several local shows , played a part in a CBS `` Movie Of The Week '' , and were guests on the local Atlanta television program `` Music Peachtree Style '' where local Atlanta - based artists were interviewed and profiled . That initial version of the `` Ed - E '' band dissolved in the mid to late 1980s due to incompatible musical tastes among other differences . Roland subsequently formed Marching Two - Step which included original Collective Soul drummer Shane Evans , Michele Rhea Caplinger , and Matt Serletic . </P> <P> Marching Two - Step were a local gigging band for a few years , but never managed to grow beyond the club scene . Roland 's early attempts to be signed to a recording contract by a label faced rejections . Caplinger would become a music industry publicist and was later appointed executive director of the Atlanta Chapter of the Recording Academy in 2000 . Serletic would go on to become a Grammy winning producer for Collective Soul , Matchbox Twenty , Blessid Union of Souls and Edwin McCain , and landed executive positions with record companies . </P> <H3> 1993 -- 94 : Hints , Allegations and Things Left Unsaid and signing to Atlantic Records ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the demise of Roland 's previous music collaborations , he enlisted musicians to record a demo in a basement . Roland initially intended to sell the songs to a publishing company and had no immediate plans of forming a band out of it . The demo was submitted to WRAS ( FM ) , 88.5 's Amy Staehling , host of the long running and popular GEORGIA MUSIC SHOW at Georgia State University 's 100,000 watt student radio station in Atlanta , the largest student run radio station in the county , where she added the song `` Shine '' to the local rotation . It was an instant listener favorite . The demo was also passed along to WJRR in Orlando , Florida which began playing `` Shine , '' soon to be its most requested song . Amidst the surprise popularity , Roland agreed to perform live shows , enlisting his brother Dean on rhythm guitar , drummer Shane Evans , bassist Will Turpin , and lead guitarist Ross Childress , in what would be the first official lineup of Collective Soul . Atlantic Records took note of the popularity of `` Shine '' and subsequently signed them to a contract . </P> <P> Upon Collective Soul 's signing , Atlantic wished to capitalize on the band 's success and quickly re-released the 1993 demo Hints Allegations and Things Left Unsaid as their first studio album . Although reluctant to have the unpolished demo represent their new lineup , Collective Soul gained international recognition and double - platinum status with their debut . The band quickly began work on what they would consider their true debut record and were invited to perform at Woodstock 1994 . They also toured extensively across North America . </P> <H3> 1995 -- 99 : Collective Soul , Disciplined Breakdown and Dosage ( edit ) </H3> <P> The group 's self - titled second album issued the following year , was certified RIAA triple platinum , and logged a 76 - week run on the Billboard 200 . Notable singles from Collective Soul included US Rock Chart No. 1 hits `` December , '' `` Where The River Flows , '' and `` The World I Know , '' No. 2 hit `` Gel , '' and the Top 10 hit `` Smashing Young Man . '' </P> <P> Following a split with their manager , Collective Soul found their tour dates canceled and were called into the courtroom to face a legal battle that lasted into 1996 , presumably with said ex-manager Bill Richardson . While the legal battles continued , the band went to a cabin , in the middle of 40 acres ( 160,000 m ) of cow pasture in Stockbridge , and began recording . They recorded into a computer their impromptu efforts of songs Roland penned , and these became Disciplined Breakdown . The legal case was eventually settled , and both parties were instructed not to discuss the outcome . </P> <P> Disciplined Breakdown , released in 1997 , did not sell as well as their previous records despite debuting higher on the charts . The album eventually achieved platinum certification , and produced two more No. 1 singles on the US Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart : `` Precious Declaration '' and `` Listen '' , and Top 20 Hit `` Blame '' . The album peaked at No. 16 on the US Billboard 200 chart . </P> <P> The band 's fourth album was 1999 's platinum certified Dosage . The first single `` Heavy '' set a new high mark for 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock chart . Singles such as `` Run '' , `` No More , No Less '' and `` Tremble For My Beloved '' gained notable positions on the rock charts . The album was produced by Anthony J. Resta , known for his work with Duran Duran and others . The band also performed at the Woodstock 1999 festival , where they performed `` Heavy '' , a cover of Ozzy Osbourne 's song `` Crazy Train '' , and a cover of U2 's song `` I Will Follow '' . </P> <H3> 2000 -- 03 : Blender , 7even year Itch and departure from Atlantic Records ( edit ) </H3> <P> The group then released their fifth studio album , Blender in October 2000 . It did not sell as well as previous albums , although the first single `` Why , Pt. 2 '' reached No. 2 on the mainstream rock chart . They achieved additional hits with `` Vent '' and Pop Hit `` Perfect Day '' the latter being a duet between Roland and Elton John . The album became RIAA certified gold . Rolling Stone gave Blender a positive review . This was their second effort with Anthony J. Resta . The song `` You Speak My Language '' was a cover of a song written by Mark Sandman , who formed Morphine in 1989 . The song was originally on Morphine 's 1992 album , Good . </P> <P> In 2001 , Collective Soul released their greatest hits compilation , Seven Year Itch : Greatest Hits 1994 -- 2001 ( the title being stylized as 7even Year Itch ) , which featured the two new songs , the single `` Next Homecoming '' and `` Energy '' . The record marked the end of the group 's contract with Atlantic Records and the departure of lead guitarist Childress due to private personal differences ( Childress had an affair with Roland 's wife ) . The band promoted their longtime guitar technician , Joel Kosche from Jovian Storm , to be the new lead guitarist . </P> <H3> 2004 -- 09 : formation of El music group , Youth , Afterwords and Collective Soul ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2004 Collective Soul created their independent label , El Music Group which allowed the band greater control over the production and distribution of their music . In November of that year , they released their sixth studio album , Youth , which debuted at No. 66 on the Billboard 200 . `` Counting the Days '' became a Top 10 rock hit . The second single , `` Better Now '' received significant airplay on Adult Top 40 radio , reaching the Top 10 , and was used in commercials for the cereal Special K . The resultant US and Canadian tours lasted over two years . The third single `` How Do You Love '' became a Top 20 hit on Adult Top 40 radio . During the recording of this album , Shane Evans was dismissed from the band due to drug use , with session musician Ryan Hoyle named as his replacement . Ryan Hoyle recorded 8 of the 11 drum / percussion tracks on this album . </P> <P> In May 2005 , they released an eight - song acoustic EP compilation titled From the Ground Up , which had acoustic versions of past favorites , plus a new track , `` Youth '' that also appeared on the WB show `` Charmed '' playing their song `` Better Now '' at the end of the episode at Piper 's Club P3 . </P> <P> Collective Soul performed two shows with the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra on April 23 and 24 , 2005 . A DVD and double disc CD of the performances , entitled Home : A Live Concert Recording With The Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra was released in February 2006 . </P> <P> Collective Soul 's seventh studio album , Afterwords was released in August 2007 . It was co-produced by Anthony J. Resta who also contributed synthesizers , percussion and lead guitar on the song `` Bearing Witness '' . The band made a deal in the US with Target stores , making it the `` exclusive physical retailer '' of Afterwords for one year . The album was immediately available in digital form on iTunes . The record debuted at # 25 on the Billboard Comprehensive Albums chart ( as albums available only from a single retailer were ineligible for the Billboard 200 at the time ) . Billboard would later amend this rule due to similar successes of other artists via similar agreements . </P> <P> The Adult Top 40 pop - rock single `` Hollywood '' was released in May . It became the theme song for the hit T.V. show American Idol . The second single `` All That I Know '' was released in November and barely charted on Adult Top 40 . </P> <P> The band made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on August 31 to promote the album where they performed `` Hollywood '' . They were also the musical guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson . </P> <P> Collective Soul released their eighth studio album , another self - titled , but designated on August 25 , 2009 with Roadrunner Records a subsidiary of their previous label Atlantic Records . The first was single `` Staring Down '' and the second single was `` Welcome All Again '' . `` Staring Down '' charted at # 18 Billboard 's Adult Top 40 . The album debuted at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 . The third single , `` You , '' also charted briefly on the Billboard Adult Top 40 . </P> <P> Collective Soul were inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in September 2009 . In their induction speech , Roland thanked a long list of former members and collaborators who had involved over the past 3 decades , including Childress , Hoyle and Brannon . He also invited Shane Evans to the stage to celebrate with the band . </P> <H3> 2010 -- 13 : focus on side projects and touring ( edit ) </H3> <P> Collective Soul returned to El Music Group in 2010 , and in December that year , the band released a re-recorded version of `` Tremble for My Beloved '' ( originally from Dosage ) as both a single and a video on iTunes . The video was also included on the DVD Music Videos and Performances from The Twilight Saga Soundtracks , Vol. 1 . </P> <P> In 2012 , the band embarked on the Dosage Tour , with touring member Johnny Rabb replacing Cheney Brannon on drums . </P> <P> Recently , the band 's members have been involved in other projects . Joel Kosche and Will Turpin began their own solo careers , releasing the albums Fight Years ( 2010 ) and The Lighthouse ( 2011 ) respectively . Dean Roland is part of the rock band Magnets and Ghosts , alongside Ryan Potesta . The duo formed in 2010 , and released their debut album , Mass , in November 2011 . In 2011 , Ed Roland began recording and touring with friends Christopher Alan Yates , Brian Biskey , Grant Reynolds and Mike Rizzi . The group , Ed Roland and the Sweet Tea Project , released their debut album , Devils ' n Darlins , on September 3 , 2013 . </P> <H3> 2014 -- present : See what You Started by Continuing and tenth studio album ( edit ) </H3> <P> The band kicked off their 2014 tour on January 15 at Belly Up in Aspen , Colorado , where lead guitarist Jesse Triplett made his live debut as a member of Collective Soul . Triplett replaced Joel Kosche , who had been with the band since replacing original lead guitarist Ross Childress in 2001 . On February 6 , Collective Soul publicly confirmed Kosche 's departure from the band : `` After 13 great years , Joel Kosche has moved on in the world of music . Collective Soul welcomes Jesse Triplett as our new lead guitarist . '' On his own Facebook page , Kosche said that he had not `` moved on in the world of music '' but that he 'd been fired . </P> <P> The band 's ninth studio album , See What You Started by Continuing , was released on October 2 , 2015 by Vanguard Records . The album 's lead single , `` This , '' made its premiere on July 15 , 2015 at USA Today . The band has made `` This '' available as a free download on their website . </P> <P> The band have begun recording songs for their tenth studio album , which is planned to be released as a double album in February 2019 . The band played two new songs , titled `` Right as rain '' and `` Rule Number One '' , from the upcoming album at the Hard Rock Casino in Northfield , Ohio on February 15th , 2018 . </P> <P> The band released a full live album `` Collective Soul - Live '' on December 8 , 2017 . The recordings were gathered from concerts the band performed during their 2016 and 2017 tours . </P> <H2> Origin of band name ( edit ) </H2> <P> According to Ed Roland , the group took its name from a phrase in The Fountainhead , citing that `` we 're not preaching Ayn Rand , objectivism , egoism , or anything ... we just dug the name .

Chromosome 21 is the smallest human autosome , with 48 million nucleotides ( the building material of DNA ) representing about 1.5 percent of the total DNA in cells . Most people have two copies of chromosome 21 , while those with three copies of chromosome 21 have Down syndrome , also called `` trisomy 21 '' . </P> <P> Researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced that they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome . Chromosome 21 was the second human chromosome to be fully sequenced , after chromosome 22 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Genes <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Number of genes </Li> <Li> 1.2 Gene list </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Diseases and disorders </Li> <Li> 3 Chromosomal conditions </Li> <Li> 4 Cytogenetic band </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Genes ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Number of genes ( edit ) </H3> <P> The following are some of the gene count estimates of human chromosome 21 . Because researchers use different approaches to genome annotation their predictions of the number of genes on each chromosome varies ( for technical details , see gene prediction ) . Among various projects , the collaborative consensus coding sequence project ( CCDS ) takes an extremely conservative strategy . So CCDS 's gene number prediction represents a lower bound on the total number of human protein - coding genes . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Estimated by </Td> <Td> Protein - coding genes </Td> <Td> Non-coding RNA genes </Td> <Td> Pseudogenes </Td> <Td> Source </Td> <Td> Release date </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> CCDS </Td> <Td> 215 </Td> <Td> - </Td> <Td> - </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 2016 - 09 - 08 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> HGNC </Td> <Td> 217 </Td> <Td> 165 </Td> <Td> 180 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 2017 - 05 - 12 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ensembl </Td> <Td> 234 </Td> <Td> 404 </Td> <Td> 183 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 2017 - 03 - 29 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NCBI </Td> <Td> 256 </Td> <Td> 356 </Td> <Td> 207 </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 2017 - 05 - 19 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Gene list ( edit ) </H3> See also : Category : Genes on human chromosome 21 . <P> The following is a partial list of genes on human chromosome 21 .

For example , acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( a type of blood cancer most often diagnosed in childhood ) has been associated with a translocation between chromosomes 12 and 21 . Another form of leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , has been associated with a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 . </Li> <Li> In a small percentage of cases , Down syndrome is caused by a rearrangement of chromosomal material between chromosome 21 and another chromosome . As a result , a person has the usual two copies of chromosome 21 , plus extra material from chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome . These cases are called translocation Down syndrome . Researchers believe that extra copies of genes on chromosome 21 disrupt the course of normal development , causing the characteristic features of Down syndrome and the increased risk of medical problems associated with this disorder . </Li> <Li> Other changes in the number or structure of chromosome 21 can have a variety of effects , including intellectual disability , delayed development , and characteristic facial features . In some cases , the signs and symptoms are similar to those of Down syndrome . Changes to chromosome 21 include a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell ( partial monosomy 21 ) and a circular structure called ring chromosome 21 . A ring chromosome occurs when both ends of a broken chromosome are reunited . </Li> <Li> Duplication in Amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) locus ( duplicated segment varies in length but includes APP ) on Chromosome 21 was found to cause early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease in a French family set ( Rovelet - Lecrux et al . ) and a Dutch family set . Compared to Alzheimer 's caused by missense mutations in APP , the frequency of the Alzheimer 's caused by APP duplications is significant . All patients that have an extra copy of APP gene due to the locus duplication show Alzheimer 's with severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Cytogenetic band ( edit ) </H2> G - banding ideograms of human chromosome 21 G - banding ideogram of human chromosome 21 in resolution 850 bphs . Band length in this diagram is proportional to base - pair length . This type of ideogram is generally used in genome browsers ( e.g. Ensembl , UCSC Genome Browser ) . G - banding patterns of human chromosome 21 in three different resolutions ( 400 , 550 and 850 ) . Band length in this diagram is based on the ideograms from ISCN ( 2013 ) .

The cauda equina occupies the lumbar cistern , a subarachnoid space inferior to the conus medullaris . The nerves that compose the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips , knees , ankles , feet , internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter . In addition , the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and , partially , parasympathetic innervation of the bladder . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Structure <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Development </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Clinical significance <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Cauda equina syndrome </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 History </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Structure ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> In humans , the spinal cord stops growing in infancy and the end of the spinal cord is about the level of the third lumbar vertebra , or L3 , at birth . Because the bones of the vertebral column continue to grow , by about 12 months of age , the end of the cord reaches its permanent position at the level of L1 or L2 ( closer to the head ) . However , due to normal anatomical variations , the final cord end position may occur anywhere from T12 twelfth thoracic vertebra ( T12 ) to L3 . Individual spinal nerve roots arise from the cord as they get closer to the head , but as the differential growth occurs , the top end of the nerve stays attached to the spinal cord while the lower end of the nerve exits the spinal column at its proper level . This results in a `` bundle '' - like structure of nerve fibers that extends caudally from the end of the spinal cord , gradually declining in number further down as individual pairs leave the spinal column . </P> <H2> Clinical significance ( edit ) </H2> <P> The cauda equina exists within the lumbar cistern , a gap between the arachnoid membrane and the pia matter of the spinal cord , called the subarachnoid space . Cerebrospinal fluid also exists within this space . Because the spinal cord terminates at level L1 / L2 , lumbar puncture ( or colloquially , `` spinal tap '' ) is performed from the lumbar cistern between two vertebrae at level L3 / L4 , or L4 / L5 , where there is no risk of accidental injury to the spinal cord , when a sample of CSF is needed for clinical purposes . </P> <H3> Cauda equina Syndrome ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cauda equina syndrome , a rare disorder affecting the bundle of nerve roots ( cauda equina ) at the lower ( lumbar ) end of the spinal cord , is a surgical emergency . Cauda equina syndrome occurs when the nerve roots in the lumbar spine are compressed , disrupting sensation and movement . Nerve roots that control the function of the bladder and bowel are especially vulnerable to damage . It can lead to permanent paralysis , impaired bladder and / or bowel control , loss of sexual sensation , and other problems if left untreated . Even with immediate treatment , some patients may not recover complete function . </P> <P> Cauda equina syndrome most commonly results from a massive disc herniation in the lumbar region . A disc herniation occurs when one of the soft flexible discs that functions as an elastic shock absorber between the bones of the spinal column displaces from its normal position . The herniation occurs after the disc begins to break down with aging and can be precipitated by stress or a mechanical problem in the spine . The result is that the softer , center portion of the disc pushes out and causes pressure on the nerve roots in the lumbar spine . Other causes include spinal lesions and tumors , spinal infections or inflammation , lumbar spinal stenosis , trauma to the lower back , birth abnormalities , spinal arteriovenous malformations ( AVMs ) , spinal hemorrhages ( subarachnoid , subdural , epidural ) , narrowing of the spinal canal , postoperative lumbar spine surgery complications or spinal anesthesia . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The cauda equina was named after its resemblance to a horse 's tail ( Latin : cauda equina ) by the French anatomist Andreas Lazarius ( André du Laurens ) in the 17th century . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> This article uses anatomical terminology ; for an overview , see Anatomical terminology . <Ul> <Li> Spinal cord </Li> <Li> Cauda equina syndrome </Li> <Li> Conus medullaris </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` LSUHSC School of Medicine - Search Results '' . www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Cauda Equina Syndrome - OrthoInfo - AAOS '' . orthoinfo.aaos.org . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : http://www.aans.org/Patient%20Information/Conditions%20and%20Treatments/Cauda%20Equina%20Syndrome.aspx </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Cauda Equina Syndrome -- The Spine Hospital at The Neurological Institute of New York '' . </Li> </Ol> <Ul> <Li> `` Cauda Equina Syndrome .

A methyl group is added to GAA from the amino acid methionine by the enzyme GAMT , forming non-phosphorylated creatine . This is then dumped into the blood by the liver where it travels mainly to the muscle cells ( 95 % of the body 's creatine is in muscles ) , and to a lesser extent the brain , heart , and pancreas . Once inside the cells it is transformed into phosphocreatine by the enzyme complex creatine kinase , which makes it able to donate its phosphate group to convert adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) into adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . This process is an important component of all vertebrates ' bioenergetic systems . For instance , while the human body only produces 250g of ATP daily , it recycles its entire body weight in ATP each day through creatine phosphate . </P> <P> Creatine phosphate can be broken down into creatinine , which is then excreted in the urine . A 70 - kg man contains around 120g of creatine , with 40 % being the unphosphorylated form and 60 % as creatine phosphate . Of that amount , 1 -- 2 % is broken down and excreted each day as creatinine . </P> <P> Phosphocreatine is used intravenously in hospitals in some parts of the world for cardiovascular problems under the name Neoton , and also used by some professional athletes , as it is not a controlled substance . </P> <H2> Function ( edit ) </H2> <P> Phosphocreatine can anaerobically donate a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP during the first two to seven seconds following an intense muscular or neuronal effort . Conversely , excess ATP can be used during a period of low effort to convert creatine to phosphocreatine . The reversible phosphorylation of creatine ( i.e. , both the forward and backward reaction ) is catalyzed by several creatine kinases . The presence of creatine kinase ( CK - MB , MB for muscle / brain ) in blood plasma is indicative of tissue damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction . The cell 's ability to generate phosphocreatine from excess ATP during rest , as well as its use of phosphocreatine for quick regeneration of ATP during intense activity , provides a spatial and temporal buffer of ATP concentration . In other words , phosphocreatine acts as high - energy reserve in a coupled reaction ; the energy given off from donating the phosphate group is used to regenerate the other compound - in this case , ATP . Phosphocreatine plays a particularly important role in tissues that have high , fluctuating energy demands such as muscle and brain . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The discovery of phosphocreatine was reported by Grace and Philip Eggleton of the University of Cambridge and separately by Cyrus Fiske and Yellapragada Subbarow of the Harvard Medical School in 1927 . A few years later David Nachmansohn , working under Meyerhof at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Dahlem , Berlin , contributed to the understanding of the phosphocreatine 's role in the cell . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Schlattner U , Tokarska - Schlattner M , Wallimann T ( 2006 ) . `` Mitochondrial creatine kinase in human health and disease '' .

It is located on the boundary between California 's Inyo and Tulare counties , 84.6 miles ( 136.2 km ) west - northwest of the lowest point in North America at Badwater Basin in Death Valley National Park at 282 ft ( 86 m ) below sea level . The west slope of the mountain is in Sequoia National Park and the summit is the southern terminus of the John Muir Trail which runs 211.9 mi ( 341.0 km ) from Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley . The east slope is in the Inyo National Forest in Inyo County . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Geography <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Hydrology </Li> <Li> 1.2 Elevation measurements </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Geology </Li> <Li> 3 Exploration history </Li> <Li> 4 Climbing routes <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Trails </Li> <Li> 4.2 Scrambles </Li> <Li> 4.3 Technical climbs </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> Sky pilot blooming on ridge just below summit . <P> The summit of Mount Whitney is on the Sierra Crest and the Great Basin Divide . It lies near many of the highest peaks of the Sierra Nevada . The peak rises dramatically above the Owens Valley , sitting 10,778 feet ( 3,285 m ) or just over two miles above the town of Lone Pine 15 miles to the east , in the Owens Valley . It rises more gradually on the west side , lying only about 3,000 feet ( 910 m ) above the John Muir Trail at Guitar Lake . </P> <P> The mountain is partially dome - shaped , with its famously jagged ridges extending to the sides . Mount Whitney is above the tree line and has an alpine climate and ecology . Very few plants grow near the summit : one example is the Skypilot , a cushion plant that grows low to the ground . The only animals are transient , such as the butterfly Parnassius phoebus and the gray - crowned rosy finch . </P> <H3> Hydrology ( edit ) </H3> <P> The mountain is the highest point on the Great Basin Divide . Waterways on the west side of the peak flow into Whitney Creek , which flows into the Kern River . The Kern River terminates in the Tulare Basin . During very wet years , water overflows from the Tulare Basin into the San Joaquin River which flows to the Pacific Ocean . From the east , water from Mount Whitney flows to Lone Pine Creek , which joins the Owens River , which in turn terminates at Owens Lake , an endorheic lake of the Great Basin . </P> <H3> Elevation measurements ( edit ) </H3> <P> The estimated elevation of the summit of Mount Whitney has changed over the years . The technology of elevation measurement has become more refined and , more importantly , the vertical coordinate system has changed . The peak was commonly said to be at 14,494 ft ( 4,418 m ) and this is the elevation stamped on the USGS brass benchmark disk on the summit . An older plaque on the summit ( sheet metal with black lettering on white enamel ) reads `` elevation 14,496.811 feet '' but this was estimated using the older vertical datum ( NGVD29 ) from 1929 . Since then the shape of the Earth ( the geoid ) has been estimated more accurately . Using a new vertical datum established in 1988 ( NAVD88 ) the benchmark is now estimated to be at 14,505 ft ( 4,421 m ) . </P> <H2> Geology ( edit ) </H2> Schematic of Sierra Nevada fault - block . <P> The eastern slope of Whitney is far steeper than its western slope because the entire Sierra Nevada is the result of a fault - block that is analogous to a cellar door : the door is hinged on the west and is slowly rising on the east . </P> <P> The rise is caused by a normal fault system that runs along the eastern base of the Sierra , below Mount Whitney . Thus , the granite that forms Mount Whitney is the same as the granite that forms the Alabama Hills , thousands of feet lower down . The raising of Whitney ( and the downdrop of the Owens Valley ) is due to the same geological forces that cause the Basin and Range Province : the crust of much of the intermontane west is slowly being stretched . </P> <P> The granite that forms Mount Whitney is part of the Sierra Nevada batholith . In Cretaceous time , masses of molten rock that originated from subduction rose underneath what is now Whitney and solidified underground to form large expanses of granite . In the last 2 to 10 million years , the Sierra was pushed up which enabled glacial and river erosion to strip the upper layers of rock to reveal the resistant granite that makes up Mount Whitney today . </P> <H2> Exploration History ( edit ) </H2> <P> In July 1864 , the members of the California Geological Survey named the peak after Josiah Whitney , the State Geologist of California and benefactor of the survey . During the same expedition , geologist Clarence King attempted to climb Whitney from its west side , but stopped just short . In 1871 , King returned to climb what he believed to be Whitney , but having taken a different approach , he actually summited nearby Mount Langley . Upon learning of his mistake in 1873 , King finally completed his own first ascent of Whitney , but did so a month too late to claim the first recorded ascent . Just a month earlier , on August 18 , 1873 , Charles Begole , A.H. Johnson , and John Lucas , all of nearby Lone Pine , had become the first to reach the highest summit in the contiguous United States . As they climbed the mountain during a fishing trip to nearby Kern Canyon , they called the mountain Fisherman 's Peak . </P> Mount Whitney as seen from Mount Langley <P> In 1881 Samuel Pierpont Langley , founder of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory remained for some time on the summit , making daily observations on the solar heat . Accompanying Langley in 1881 was another party consisting of Judge William B. Wallace of Visalia , W.A. Wright and Reverend Frederick Wales . Wallace later wrote in his memoirs that `` The Pi Ute ( Paiute ) Indians called Mt . Whitney `` Too - man - i - goo - yah , '' which means `` the very old man . '' They believe that the Great Spirit who presides over the destiny of their people once had his home in that mountain . '' The spelling Too - man - i - goo - yah is a transliteration from the indigenous Paiute Mono language . Other variations are Too - man - go - yah and Tumanguya . </P> <P> In 1891 , the United States Geological Survey 's Board on Geographic Names decided to recognize the earlier name Mount Whitney . Despite losing out on their preferred name , residents of Lone Pine financed the first trail to the summit , engineered by Gustave Marsh , and completed on July 22 , 1904 . Just four days later , the new trail enabled the first recorded death on Whitney . Having hiked the trail , U.S. Bureau of Fisheries employee Byrd Surby was struck and killed by lightning while eating lunch on the exposed summit . In response to this event , Marsh began work on the stone hut that would become the Smithsonian Institution Shelter , and completed it in 1909 . </P> <P> A movement after World War II began to rename the mountain for Winston Churchill . However , the name Mount Whitney has persisted . </P> <H2> Climbing routes ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Trails ( edit ) </H3> The Smithsonian Institution Shelter on Whitney 's summit . <P> The most popular route to the summit is by way of the Mount Whitney Trail which starts at Whitney Portal , at an elevation of 8,360 ft ( 2,550 m ) , 13 mi ( 21 km ) west of the town of Lone Pine . The hike is about 22 mi ( 35 km ) round trip with an elevation gain of over 6,100 ft ( 1,900 m ) . Permits are required year round , and to prevent overuse a limited number of permits are issued by the Forest Service between May 1 and November 1 . The Forest Service holds an annual lottery for hiking and backpacking permits on the Mount Whitney Trail . Applications are accepted from February 1 through March 15 . Any permits left over after the lottery is completed typically go on sale April 1 . Most hikers do the trip in two days which is still considered a strenuous endeavor . Those in good physical condition sometimes attempt to reach the summit and return to Whitney Portal in one day , thus requiring only a somewhat easier - to - obtain `` day use '' permit rather than the overnight permit , and prohibiting the use of overnight camping gear ( sleeping bag and tent ) . This is considered an `` extreme '' day hike , which normally involves leaving Whitney Portal before sunrise and 12 to 18 hours of strenuous hiking , while contending with altitude sickness , cold air , and occasionally treacherous surface conditions ( because snow and / or ice are normally present on parts of the trail , except for a short period from early July to late September ) . </P> Long - exposure photograph of hikers ascending Whitney before sunrise via the John Muir Trail <P> Longer approaches to Whitney arrive at its west side , connecting to the Mount Whitney Trail near the summit by way of the John Muir Trail . </P> <H3> Scrambles ( edit ) </H3> <P> The `` Mountaineer 's Route '' , a gully on the north side of the east face first climbed by John Muir , is considered a scramble , class 3 ( PD+ ) . The fastest recorded time up this route to the summit and back to the portal is 3 hours 10 minutes , by Jason Lakey of Bishop . </P> <H3> Technical Climbs ( edit ) </H3> Railings on the Mount Whitney Trail switchbacks . <P> The steep eastern side of the mountain offers a variety of climbing challenges . The East Face route , first climbed in 1931 , is one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America routes and involves technical free climbing ( class 5.7 ) but is mostly class 4 . Other routes range up to grade 5.10 d . </P> <P> South of the main summit there are a series of minor summits that are completely inconspicuous from the west but appear as a series of `` needles '' from the east . The routes on these include some of the finest big - wall climbing in the high Sierra . Two of the needles were named after participants in an 1880 scientific expedition to the mountain . Keeler Needle was named for James Keeler and Day Needle was named for William Cathcart Day . The latter has now been renamed Crooks Peak after Hulda Crooks who hiked up Mount Whitney every year until well into her nineties . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Mountains portal </Li> <Li> California portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of mountain peaks of California </Li> <Li> List of highest points in California by county </Li> <Li> List of U.S. states by elevation </Li> <Li> List of the highest major summits of the United States </Li> <Li> List of the most prominent summits of the United States </Li> <Li> List of the most isolated major summits of the United States </Li> <Li> Whitney Classic </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Playas Valley / Pride Draw Saddle '' .

The largest confirmed individual had a length of 12.65 m ( 41.5 ft ) and a weight of about 21.5 t ( 47,000 lb ) . The whale shark holds many records for sheer size in the animal kingdom , most notably being by far the largest living nonmammalian vertebrate . It is the sole member of the genus Rhincodon and the only extant member of the family Rhincodontidae which belongs to the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes . Before 1984 it was classified as Rhiniodon into Rhinodontidae . The species originated about 60 million years ago . </P> <P> The whale shark is found in open waters of the tropical oceans and is rarely found in water below 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) . Modeling suggests a lifespan of about 70 years , but measurements have proven difficult . Whale sharks have very large mouths and are filter feeders , which is a feeding mode that occurs in only two other sharks , the megamouth shark and the basking shark . They feed almost exclusively on plankton and are not known to pose a threat to humans . </P> <P> The species was distinguished in April 1828 after the harpooning of a 4.6 m ( 15 ft ) specimen in Table Bay , South Africa . Andrew Smith , a military doctor associated with British troops stationed in Cape Town , described it the following year . The name `` whale shark '' refers to the fish 's size , being as large as some species of whales , and also to its being a filter feeder like baleen whales . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Description </Li> <Li> 2 Distribution and habitat </Li> <Li> 3 Reproduction </Li> <Li> 4 Diet </Li> <Li> 5 Interactions with humans <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Behavior toward divers </Li> <Li> 5.2 Conservation status </Li> <Li> 5.3 In captivity </Li> <Li> 5.4 Human culture </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Further reading </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Description ( edit ) </H2> Jaws Teeth 21 ton whale shark caught in China in 2008 <P> Whale sharks have a mouth that can be 1.5 m ( 4.9 ft ) wide , containing 300 to 350 rows of tiny teeth and 10 filter pads which it uses to filter feed . Whale sharks have five large pairs of gills . The head is wide and flat with two small eyes at the front . Whale sharks are grey with a white belly . Their skin is marked with pale yellow spots and stripes which are unique to each individual . The whale shark has three prominent ridges along its sides . Its skin can be up to 10 cm ( 3.9 in ) thick . The shark has a pair of dorsal fins and pectoral fins . Juveniles ' tails have a larger upper fin than lower fin , while the adult tail becomes semi lunate . The whale shark 's spiracles are just behind its eyes . </P> <P> The whale shark is the largest non-cetacean animal in the world . The average size of adult whale sharks is estimated at 9.7 m ( 31.82 ft ) and 9 t ( 20,000 lb ) . Several specimens over 18 m ( 59.05 ft ) in length have been reported . The largest verified specimen was caught on 11 November 1947 , near Baba Island , in Karachi , Pakistan . It was 12.65 m ( 41.50 ft ) long , weighed about 21.5 t ( 47,000 lb ) , and had a girth of 7 m ( 23.0 ft ) . Stories exist of vastly larger specimens -- quoted lengths of 18 m ( 59 ft ) and 45.5 t ( 100,000 lb ) are common in the popular literature , but no scientific records support their existence . In 1868 , the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles , but claimed to have observed specimens in excess of 15 m ( 49.2 ft ) , and tells of shark specimens surpassing 21 m ( 68.9 ft ) . </P> <P> In a 1925 publication , Hugh M. Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919 . The shark was too heavy to pull ashore , but Smith estimated the shark was at least 17 m ( 56 ft ) long , and weighed around 37 t . These measurements have been exaggerated to 43 t ( 95,000 lb ) and a more precise 17.98 m ( 59.0 ft ) in recent years . A shark caught in 1994 off Tainan County , southern Taiwan , reportedly weighed 35.8 t ( 79,000 lb ) . There have even been unverified claims of whale sharks of up to 23 metres ( 75 ft ) and 100 tonnes ( 220,000 lb ) . In 1934 , a ship named the Maurguani came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean , rammed it , and the shark became stuck on the prow of the ship , supposedly with 4.6 m ( 15 ft ) on one side and 12.2 m ( 40 ft ) on the other . No reliable documentation exists for these claims and they remain `` fish stories '' . </P> <H2> Distribution and habitat ( edit ) </H2> <P> The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm - temperate seas . The fish is primarily pelagic , living in the open sea but not in the greater depths of the ocean , although it is known to occasionally dive to depths of as much as 1,800 metres ( 5,900 ft ) . Seasonal feeding aggregations occur at several coastal sites such as the southern and eastern parts of South Africa ; Saint Helena Island in the South Atlantic Ocean ; Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti , Gladden Spit in Belize ; Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia ; Lakshadweep , Gulf of Kutch and Saurashtra coast of Gujarat in India ; Útila in Honduras ; Southern Leyte ; Donsol , Pasacao and Batangas in the Philippines ; off Isla Mujeres and Isla Holbox in Yucatan and Bahía de los Ángeles in Baja California , México ; Maamigili island , Maldives ; Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia ; Cenderawasih Bay National Park in Nabire , Papua , Indonesia ; Flores Island , Indonesia ; Nosy Be in Madagascar ; off Tofo Beach near Inhambane in Mozambique ; the Tanzanian islands of Mafia , Pemba , Zanzibar ; Gulf of Tadjoura in Djibouti , the Ad Dimaniyat Islands in the Gulf of Oman and Al Hallaniyat islands in the Arabian Sea ; and , very rarely , Eilat , Israel and Aqaba , Jordan . Although typically seen offshore , it has been found closer to land , entering lagoons or coral atolls , and near the mouths of estuaries and rivers . Its range is generally restricted to about 30 ° latitude . It is capable of diving to depths of at least 1,286 m ( 4,219 ft ) , and is migratory . On 7 February 2012 , a large whale shark was found floating 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) off the coast of Karachi , Pakistan . The length of the specimen was said to be between 11 and 12 m ( 36 and 39 ft ) , with a weight of around 15,000 kg ( 33,000 lb ) . </P> <P> In 2011 , more than 400 whale sharks gathered off the Yucatan Coast . It was one of the largest gatherings of whale sharks recorded . Aggregations in that area are among the most reliable seasonal gatherings known for whale sharks , with large numbers occurring in most years between May and September . Associated ecotourism has grown rapidly to unsustainable levels . </P> <H2> Reproduction ( edit ) </H2> <P> Neither mating nor pupping of whale sharks has been observed . </P> <P> The capture of a female in July 1996 that was pregnant with 300 pups indicated whale sharks are ovoviviparous . The eggs remain in the body and the females give birth to live young which are 40 to 60 cm ( 16 to 24 in ) long . Evidence indicates the pups are not all born at once , but rather the female retains sperm from one mating and produces a steady stream of pups over a prolonged period . They reach sexual maturity at around 30 years and their lifespan is an estimated 70 to 100 years . </P> <P> On 7 March 2009 , marine scientists in the Philippines discovered what is believed to be the smallest living specimen of the whale shark . The young shark , measuring only 38 cm ( 15 in ) , was found with its tail tied to a stake at a beach in Pilar , Sorsogon , Philippines , and was released into the wild . Based on this discovery , some scientists no longer believe this area is just a feeding ground ; this site may be a birthing ground , as well . Both young whale sharks and pregnant females have been seen in the waters of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean , where numerous whale sharks can be spotted during the summer . </P> <H2> Diet ( edit ) </H2> Whale shark filtering plankton in Maldives A whale shark in the Philippines with remoras <P> The whale shark is a filter feeder -- one of only three known filter - feeding shark species ( along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark ) . It feeds on plankton including copepods , krill , fish eggs , Christmas Island red crab larvae and small nektonic life , such as small squid or fish . It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals . The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding . Feeding occurs either by ram filtration , in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward , pushing water and food into the mouth , or by active suction feeding , in which the animal opens and closes its mouth , sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills . In both cases , the filter pads serve to separate food from water . These unique , black sieve - like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers . Food separation in whale sharks is by cross-flow filtration , in which the water travels nearly parallel to the filter pad surface , not perpendicularly through it , before passing to the outside , while denser food particles continue to the back of the throat . This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the filter pad surface . Whale sharks have been observed `` coughing '' , presumably to clear a build - up of particles from the filter pads . Whale sharks migrate to feed and possibly to breed . </P> <P> The whale shark is an active feeder , targeting concentrations of plankton or fish . It is able to ram filter feed or can gulp in a stationary position . This is in contrast to the passive feeding basking shark , which does not pump water . Instead , it swims to force water across its gills . </P> <P> A juvenile whale shark is estimated to eat 21 kg ( 46 pounds ) of plankton per day . </P> <P> The BBC program Planet Earth filmed a whale shark feeding on a school of small fish . The same documentary showed footage of a whale shark timing its arrival to coincide with the mass spawning of fish shoals and feeding on the resultant clouds of eggs and sperm . </P> <P> Whale sharks are known to prey on a range of planktonic and small nektonic organisms that are spatiotemporally patchy . These include krill , crab larvae , jellyfish , sardines , anchovies , mackerels , small tunas , and squid . In ram filter feeding , the fish swims forward at constant speed with its mouth fully open , straining prey particles from the water by forward propulsion . This is also called ' passive feeding ' , which usually occurs when prey is present at low density . </P> <H2> Interactions with humans ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Behavior toward divers ( edit ) </H3> In Oslob , Philippines , whale sharks are fed shrimp to return every morning for tourists and divers . <P> Despite its size , the whale shark does not pose significant danger to humans . Whale sharks are docile fish and sometimes allow swimmers to catch a ride , although this practice is discouraged by shark scientists and conservationists because of the disturbance to the sharks . Younger whale sharks are gentle and can play with divers . Underwater photographers such as Fiona Ayerst have photographed them swimming close to humans without any danger . </P> <P> The shark is seen by divers in many places , including the Bay Islands in Honduras , Thailand , the Philippines , the Maldives close to Maamigili ( South Ari Atoll ) , the Red Sea , Western Australia ( Ningaloo Reef , Christmas Island ) , Taiwan , Panama ( Coiba Island ) , Belize , Tofo Beach in Mozambique , Sodwana Bay ( Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park ) in South Africa , the Galapagos Islands , Saint Helena , Isla Mujeres ( Caribbean Sea ) , La Paz , Baja California Sur and Bahía de los Ángeles in Mexico , the Seychelles , West Malaysia , islands off eastern peninsular Malaysia , India , Sri Lanka , Oman , Fujairah , Puerto Rico , and other parts of the Caribbean . Juveniles can be found near the shore in the Gulf of Tadjoura , near Djibouti , in the Horn of Africa . </P> Swimming alongside an adult free diver <H3> Conservation status ( edit ) </H3> <P> There is currently no robust estimate of the global whale shark population . The species is considered endangered by the IUCN due to the impacts of fisheries , bycatch losses , and vessel strikes , combined with its long life span and late maturation . It is listed , along with six other species of sharks , under the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks . In 1998 , the Philippines banned all fishing , selling , importing , and exporting of whale sharks for commercial purposes , followed by India in May 2001 , and Taiwan in May 2007 . </P> <P> In 2010 , the Gulf of Mexico oil spill resulted in 4,900,000 barrels ( 780,000 m ) of oil flowing into an area south of the Mississippi River Delta , where one - third of all whale shark sightings in the northern part of the gulf have occurred in recent years . Sightings confirmed that the whale sharks were unable to avoid the oil slick , which was situated on the surface of the sea where the whale sharks feed for several hours at a time . No dead whale sharks were found . </P> <P> This species was also added to Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) in 2003 to regulate the international trade of live specimens and its parts . </P> <P> Hundreds of Whale Sharks are killed annually illegally in China . </P> <H3> In captivity ( edit ) </H3> A whale shark in the Georgia Aquarium <P> Because of its iconic status , the whale shark is popular in the few public aquariums that keep it , but its large size means that a very large tank is required and it has specialized feeding requirements . Their large size and iconic status have also fuelled an opposition to keeping the species in captivity , especially after the early death of some whale sharks in captivity and certain Chinese aquariums keeping the species in relatively small tanks . </P> Whale sharks at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium , Japan <P> The first attempt at keeping whale sharks in captivity was in 1934 when an individual was kept for about four months in a netted - off natural bay in Izu , Japan . The first attempt of keeping whale sharks in an aquarium was initiated in 1980 by the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium ( then Ocean Expo Park ) in Japan . Since 1980 , several have been kept at Okinawa , mostly obtained from incidental catches in coastal nets set by fishers ( none after 2009 ) , but two were strandings . Several of these were already weak from the capture / stranding and some were released , but initial captive survival rates were low . After the initial difficulties in maintaining the species had been resolved , some have survived long - term in captivity . The record for a whale shark in captivity is an individual that , as of 2017 , has lived for more than 18 years in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium . Following Okinawa , Osaka Aquarium started keeping whale sharks and most of the basic research on the keeping of the species was made at these two institutions . Since the mid-1990s , several other aquariums have kept the species in Japan ( Kagoshima City Aquarium , Kinosaki Marine World , Notojima Aquarium , Oita Ecological Aquarium , and Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise ) , South Korea ( Aquaplanet Jeju ) , China ( Chimelong Ocean Kingdom , Dalian Aquarium , Guangzhou Aquarium in Guangzhou Zoo , Qingdao Polar Ocean World and Yantai Aquarium ) , Taiwan ( National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium ) , India ( Aquarium Thiruvananthapuram ) and Dubai ( Atlantis , The Palm ) , with some maintaining whale sharks for years and others only for a very short period . The whale shark kept at Dubai 's Atlantis , The Palm was rescued from shallow water in 2008 with extensive abrasions to the fins and after rehabilitation it was released in 2010 , having lived 19 months in captivity . Marine Life Park in Singapore had planned on keeping whale sharks , but scrapped this idea in 2009 . </P> <P> Outside Asia , the first and so far only place to keep whale sharks is Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta , United States . This is unusual because of the comparatively long transport time and complex logistics required to bring the sharks to the aquarium , ranging between 28 and 36 hours . Georgia keeps four whale sharks : two females , Alice and Trixie , that arrived in 2006 , and two males , Taroko and Yushan , that arrived in 2007 . Two earlier males at Georgia Aquarium , Ralph and Norton , both died in 2007 . Georgia 's whale sharks were all imported from Taiwan and were taken from the commercial fishing quota for the species , usually used locally for food . Taiwan closed this fishery entirely in 2008 . </P> <H3> Human culture ( edit ) </H3> Play media Snorkelling with whale shark near Isla Mujeres ( Mexico ) 30 August 2011 <P> In Vietnamese culture , the whale shark is referred to as `` sir fish '' . </P> <P> In the Philippines , it is called butanding and balilan . The whale shark is featured on the reverse of the Philippine 100 - peso bill . By law snorkelers must maintain a distance of four feet from the sharks and there is a fine and possible jail time for anyone who touches the animals . The whale shark is also featured on the latest 2015 - 2017 edition of the Maldivian 1000 rufiyaa banknote , along with the green turtle . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> For a topical guide to this subject , see Outline of sharks . <Ul> <Li> List of sharks </Li> <Li> List of threatened sharks </Li> <Li> Sharks portal </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Jurassic Shark ( 2000 ) documentary by Jacinth O'Donnell ; broadcast on Discovery Channel , 5 August 2006 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Pierce , S.J. & Norman , B.

Although affordable ox - bone balls were in common use in Europe , elephant ivory was favored since at least 1627 until the early 20th century ; the earliest known written reference to ivory billiard balls is in the 1588 inventory of the Duke of Norfolk . By the mid-19th century , elephants were being slaughtered for their ivory at an alarming rate , just to keep up with the demand for high - end billiard balls -- no more than eight balls could be made from a single elephant 's tusks . The billiard industry realized that the supply of elephants ( their primary source of ivory ) was endangered , as well as dangerous to obtain ( the latter an issue of notable public concern at the turn of the 19th century ) . Inventors were challenged to come up with an alternative material that could be manufactured , with a US $ 10,000 prize being offered by a New York supplier , Phelan and Collender . ( This would be worth approximately $183,850.0 in 2018 . ) </P> <P> Although not the first artificial substance to be used for the balls ( e.g. Sorel cement , invented in 1867 , was marketed as an artificial ivory ) , John Wesley Hyatt invented a composition material in 1869 called nitrocellulose for billiard balls ( US patent 50359 , the first American patent for billiard balls ) . It is unclear if the cash prize was ever awarded , and there is no evidence suggesting he did in fact win it . By 1870 it was commercially branded Celluloid , the first industrial plastic . Unfortunately , the nature of celluloid made it volatile in production , occasionally exploding , which ultimately made this early plastic impractical . Urban legend has it that celluloid billiard balls themselves would occasionally explode during rough play , but no reliable sources have been found that can substantiate this . </P> <P> Subsequently , to avoid the problem of celluloid instability , the industry experimented with various other synthetic materials for billiard balls such as Bakelite , Crystallite and other plastic compounds . </P> <P> The exacting requirements of the billiard ball are met today with balls cast from plastic materials that are strongly resistant to cracking and chipping . Currently Saluc , under the brand names Aramith and Brunswick Centennial , manufactures phenolic resin balls . Other plastics and resins such as polyester ( under various trade names ) and clear acrylic are also used , by competing companies such as Elephant Balls Ltd. and Frenzy Sports . </P> <P> Ivory balls remained in use in artistic billiards competition until the late 20th century . </P> <Dl> <Dd> ( See also Cue sports , `` History '' for more - general information on billiards history . ) </Dd> </Dl> <H2> Types ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Carom billiards ( edit ) </H3> A standard set of carom billiards balls ( 61.5 mm ( ​ 2 ⁄ in ) diameter ) , including a red object ball , a plain white cue ball , and a dotted cue ball for the opponent . Some games use an additional object ball . <P> In the realm of carom ( or carambole ) games , billiard balls are the three ( sometimes four ) balls used to play straight - rail , three - cushion , balkline , and related games on pocketless billiards tables , as well as English billiards which is played on a table with pockets . The predominantly Asian game four - ball uses four balls ( the name literally means `` four - balls '' ) . Carom balls are not numbered , and at 61 -- 61.5 mm ( between approximately ​ 2 ⁄ and ​ 2 ⁄ in ) in diameter are larger than pool balls . The 61.5 mm size are more common . They are typically colored as follows : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Ul> <Li> Red object ball ( or , uncommonly , blue ; two object balls are used in some games ) </Li> <Li> White cue ball for player 1 </Li> <Li> White with a spot ( or sometimes yellow ) cue ball for player 2 </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> International pool ( edit ) </H3> <P> </P> Old - style pool balls racked for a game of ten - ball , just before the break shot . Modern - style pool balls <P> Pool balls are used to play various pool ( pocket billiards or pool billiards ) games , such as eight - ball , nine - ball and one - pocket . In North America , they are sometimes referred to simply as `` billiard balls '' ( except among carom players ) . These balls , used the most widely throughout the world , are considerably smaller than carom billiards balls , slightly larger than British - style pool balls and substantially larger than those for snooker . According to WPA / BCA equipment specifications , the weight may be from 5.5 to 6.0 oz ( 160 -- 170 g ) with a diameter of 2.250 in ( 57.2 mm ) , plus or minus 0.005 in ( 0.127 mm ) . These are often referred to as 2 ⁄ - inch ( 57 mm ) balls .

Though it looks similar to the solids , the 8 ball is not considered a solid because it is the only ball that is black . Some games such as nine - ball do not distinguish between stripes and solids , but rather use the numbering on the balls to determine which object ball must be pocketed . In other games such as three - ball and straight pool neither type of marking is of any consequence . In eight - ball , straight pool , and related games , all sixteen balls are employed . In the games of seven - ball , nine - ball , ten - ball and related , only object balls 1 through 7 , 9 and 10 , respectively ( plus the cue ball ) are used . </P> <P> Some balls used in televised pool games are colored differently in order to make them distinguishable on television monitors . Specifically , the 4 ball is colored pink instead of dark purple , and the 12 is white with a pink stripe , to make it easier to distinguish their color from the black 8 ball , and similarly the 7 and 15 balls use a light tan color instead of a deep brown . Television was also the genesis of the `` measle '' cue ball with numerous spots on its surface so that spin placed on it is evident to viewers . </P> <P> Coin - operated pool tables such as those found at bars historically have often used either a larger ( `` grapefruit '' ) or denser ( `` rock '' , typically ceramic ) cue ball , such that its extra weight makes it easy for the cue ball return mechanism to separate it from object balls ( which are captured until the game ends and the table is paid again for another game ) so that the cue ball can be returned for further play , should it be accidentally potted . Rarely in the US , some pool tables use a smaller cue ball instead . Modern tables usually employ a magnetic ball of regulation or near - regulation size and weight , since players have complained for many decades that the heavy and often oversized cue balls do not `` play '' correctly . </P> A set of billard balls <H3> British - style pool ( blackball ) ( edit ) </H3> Playing blackball , with its distinctive red and yellow groups . <P> In WPA blackball and its predecessor WEPF or English eight - ball pool ( not to be confused with the games of eight - ball or English billiards ) , fifteen object balls again are used , but fall into two unnumbered groups , the reds ( or less commonly blues ) and yellows , with a white cue ball , and black 8 ball . Aside from the 8 , shots are not called since there is no reliable way to identify particular balls to be pocketed . Because they are unnumbered they are wholly unsuited to certain pool games , such as nine - ball , in which ball order is important . They are noticeably smaller than the American - style balls , and with a cue ball that is slightly smaller than the object balls , while the table 's pockets are tighter to compensate . Neither the WPA nor the WEPF ( publicly ) define ball or even table dimensions , though presumably league and tournament organizers are given some guidelines in this regard . Most manufacturers that supply this market provide sets that range from 2 inches ( 51 mm ) up to 2 ⁄ inches ( 56 mm ) , often with a slightly smaller cue ball , e.g. 1 ⁄ in ( 48 mm ) for a 2 - inch set . The most common object ball diameters are 2 in ( 51 mm ) and 2 ⁄ in ( 54 mm ) . The yellow - and - red sets are sometimes commercially referred to as `` casino sets '' ( they were formerly used for televised eight - ball championships , most often held in casinos ) . The use of such sets , however , predates television , as they were used for B.B.C. Co . Pool , the forerunner of modern eight - ball , at least as early as 1908 . </P> <H3> Snooker ( edit ) </H3> Complete set of snooker balls . <Table> <Tr> <Th> Colour </Th> <Th> Value </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Red </Td> <Td> 1 point </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Yellow </Td> <Td> 2 points </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Green </Td> <Td> 3 points </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Brown </Td> <Td> 4 points </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Blue </Td> <Td> 5 points </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Pink </Td> <Td> 6 points </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Black </Td> <Td> 7 points </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Ball sets for the sport of snooker look at first glance like a mixture of American - and British - style pool balls .

( See snooker for more information on ball setup . ) </P> <P> The colour balls are sometimes numbered American - style , with their point values , for the amateur / home market , as follows in the adjacent table . </P> <P> Snooker balls are technically standardized at 52.5 mm ( 2.07 in ) in diameter within a tolerance of plus or minus 0.05 mm ( 0.002 in ) .

However , many sets are actually 2 ⁄ in ( 52.4 mm ) , even from major manufacturers . Snooker sets are also available with considerably smaller - than - regulation balls ( and even with ten instead of fifteen reds ) for play on smaller tables ( down to half - size ) , and are sanctioned for use in some amateur leagues . Sets for American snooker are typically 2 ⁄ in ( 54.0 mm ) , with numbered colour balls . </P> <P> The set of eight colours used for snooker balls ( including white ) are thought to be derived from the game of croquet . Snooker was invented in 1884 by British Army officers stationed in India . Croquet reached its peak popularity at the same time , particularly amongst people in the same social context . The eight coloured balls of croquet use the same identical set of eight colours . There are many other similarities between croquet and snooker , which when taken together , suggest that the derivation of the latter owes much to the existence of the former . </P> <H3> Other games ( edit ) </H3> Russian pyramid ball at a corner pocket . The relative size of the ball and the pocket makes the game very challenging . <P> Various other games have their own variants of billiard balls . Russian pyramid use a set of fifteen numbered but otherwise all - white balls , and a red or yellow cue ball , that may be even larger than carom billiards balls , at 68 mm ( 2 ⁄ in ) or 72 mm ( 2 ⁄ in ) . The related Finnish game kaisa has the same pocket and ball dimensions but it has only five balls : one yellow , two reds and two cue balls , one for each player . Bumper pool requires four white and four red object balls , and two special balls , one red with a white spot and the other the opposite ; all are usually ​ 2 ⁄ inch ( approximately 52.5 mm ) in diameter . </P> <H3> Training balls ( edit ) </H3> The Jim Rempe Training Ball <P> Several brands of practice balls exist , which have systems of spots , stripes , differently colored halves and / or targeting rings . </P> <P> For example , Saluc markets several practice ball systems , including the Jim Rempe Training Ball , a cue ball marked with rings and targets on the surface of the ball so that the practicing player can better judge the effects of very particular amounts of sidespin , topspin , backspin and other forms of cue ball control , and learn better control of cue stroke . Various competing products , such as several other Saluc models and Elephant Practice Balls , use a similar aiming system . Some such sets consist of just a special cue ball and manual , while others also include an object ball marked for aiming practice . </P> <H3> Novelty balls ( edit ) </H3> A striped `` referee '' 8 ball from a set of American football team logo balls . Various novelty pocket billiards balls . Clockwise from the top : Red and white balls and markers from a proprietary game called Starball ; an Elvis Presley commemorative cue ball from Graceland ; a leopard - patterned 9 ball ; colorful balls from a poker - themed set ; regular balls and the small `` jack '' from a miniature bocce set used on a table instead of a lawn or court . <P> There is a market for specialty cue balls and even entire ball sets , featuring sports team logos , cartoon characters , animal pelt patterns , etc . </P> <P> Entrepreneurial inventors also supply a variety of novelty billiard games with unique rules and balls , some with playing card markings , others with stars and stripes , and yet others in sets of more than thirty balls in several suits . Marbled - looking and glittery materials are also popular for home tables . There are even blacklight sets for playing in near - dark . There are also practical joke cue and 8 balls , with off - center weights in them that make their paths curve and wobble . Miniature sets in various sizes ( typically ​ ⁄ or ​ ⁄ of normal size ) are also commonly available , primarily intended for undersized toy tables . Even an egg - shaped ball has been patented and marketed under such names as Bobble Ball and Tag Ball . </P> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> A Magic 8 Ball Ballistic missile submarine USS Sam Rayburn displays a billiard motif on her missile hatches <P> The 8 ball is frequently used iconically in Western , especially American , culture . It can often be found as an element of T - shirt designs , album covers and names , tattoos , household goods like paperweights and cigarette lighters , belt buckles , etc . A classic toy is the Magic 8 - Ball `` oracle '' . A wrestler , a rapper , and a rock band have all independently adopted the name . The term `` 8 ball '' is also slang both for ​ ⁄ oz. of cocaine or crystal meth , and for a bottle of Olde English 800 malt liquor . It has also been used to refer to African - Americans , particularly those of darker skin tones , as in the film Full Metal Jacket . The expression `` behind the eight ( ball ) '' is used to indicate a dilemma from which it is difficult to extricate oneself . The term derives from the game kelly pool . </P> <P> Because the collisions between billiard balls are nearly elastic , and the balls roll on a surface that produces low rolling friction , their behavior is often used to illustrate Newton 's laws of motion . Idealized , frictionless billiard balls are a staple of mathematical theorems and physics models , and figure in dynamical billiards , scattering theory , Lissajous knots , billiard ball computing and reversible cellular automata , Polchinski 's paradox , contact dynamics , collision detection , the illumination problem , atomic ultracooling , quantum mirages and elsewhere in these fields . </P> <P> `` Billiard balls '' or `` pool balls '' is the name given to balls used in stage magic tricks , especially the classic `` multiplying billiard balls '' . Though obviously derived from real billiard balls , today they are usually smaller , for easier manipulation and hiding , but not so small and light that they are difficult to juggle , as the magic and juggling disciplines have often overlapped since their successful combination by pioneers like Paul Vandy . </P> <P> An urban legend received cultural attention to many saying , `` If the Earth were the size of a billiard ball , it would be smoother '' . It was used in 2008 's Discover Magazine , but mistook the diameter tolerance for smoothness . If the Earth were reduced to the size of a billiard ball , much of it , excluding the Himalayas and Mariana Trench , would be smoother . ( see also : Earth 's Shape ) </P> <P> The phrase `` as smooth as a billiard ball '' is sometimes applied to describe a bald person , and the term `` cue ball '' is also slang for someone who sports a shaved head . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Note : Antique ox - bone balls remain a very common item on eBay . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Shamos , Mike ( 1999 ) .

It was first issued in Great Britain on 1 May 1840 , but not valid for use until 6 May . It features a profile of Queen Victoria . </P> <P> In 1837 , British postal rates were high , complex and anomalous . To simplify matters , Sir Rowland Hill proposed an adhesive stamp to indicate pre-payment of postage . At the time it was normal for the recipient to pay postage on delivery , charged by the sheet and on distance travelled . By contrast , the Penny Black allowed letters of up to ⁄ ounce ( 14 grams ) to be delivered at a flat rate of one penny , regardless of distance . </P> <P> Postal delivery systems using what may have been adhesive stamps existed before the Penny Black . The idea had at least been suggested earlier in the Austrian Empire , Sweden , and possibly Greece . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Treasury competition </Li> <Li> 2 Design </Li> <Li> 3 Issue </Li> <Li> 4 Imprimatur sheet </Li> <Li> 5 Printing </Li> <Li> 6 Rarity </Li> <Li> 7 The VR official </Li> <Li> 8 Popular culture </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References and sources </Li> <Li> 11 Further reading </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Treasury competition ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 13 February 1837 , Sir Rowland Hill proposed to a government enquiry both the idea of a pre-paid stamp and a pre-paid envelope , a separate sheet folded to form an enclosure for carrying letters . Hill was given a two - year contract to run the new system , and together with Henry Cole he announced a competition to design the new stamps . There were some 2,600 entries , but none was considered suitable ; instead a rough design endorsed by Hill was chosen , featuring an easily recognisable profile of the former Princess Victoria . Hill believed this would be difficult to forge . An envelope bearing a reproduction of a design created by the artist William Mulready was also issued . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> The portrait of Victoria was engraved by Charles Heath and his son Frederick , based on a sketch provided by Henry Corbould . Corbould 's sketch was in turn based on the 1834 cameo - like head by William Wyon , which was used on a medal to commemorate the Queen 's visit to the City of London in 1837 . This portrait of Victoria remained on British stamps until her death in 1901 , although by then she was 81 years old . All British stamps still bear a portrait or silhouette of the monarch somewhere on the design . They are the only postage stamps in the world that do not indicate a country of origin ; the monarch 's image symbolises the United Kingdom . </P> <P> Initially , Hill specified that the stamps should be 3 / 4 inch square , but altered the dimensions to 3 / 4 inch wide by 7 / 8 inch tall ( approx 19 x 22 mm ) to accommodate the writing at the bottom . The word `` POSTAGE '' at the top of the design distinguishes it from a revenue stamp , which had long been used in the UK ; `` ONE PENNY . '' at the bottom shows the amount pre-paid for postage of the stamped letter . The background to the portrait consists of finely engraved engine turnings . </P> <P> The two upper corners hold Maltese crosses with radiant solar discs at their centres ; the lower corner letters show the position of the stamp in the printed sheet , from `` A A '' at top left to `` T L '' at bottom right . The sheets , printed by Perkins Bacon , consisted of 240 stamps in 20 rows of 12 columns . One full sheet cost 240 pence or one pound ; one row of 12 stamps cost a shilling . As the name suggests , the stamp was printed in black ink . A two penny stamp printed in blue and covering the double - letter rate ( up to 1 oz or 28 g ) was issued on 8 May 1840 . </P> <H2> Issue ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although the stamps were not officially issued for sale until 6 May 1840 , some offices such as those in Bath sold the stamps unofficially before that date . There are covers postmarked 2 May , and a single example is known on cover dated 1 May 1840 . All London post offices received official supplies of the new stamps but other offices throughout the United Kingdom did not , continuing to accept payments for postage in cash for a period . </P> <P> The Penny Black lasted less than a year . A red cancellation was hard to see on the black design and the red ink was easy to remove ; both made it possible to re-use cancelled stamps . In February 1841 , the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead , which was more effective and harder to remove . However , people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole , so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order . </P> <H2> Imprimatur sheet ( edit ) </H2> <P> Imprimatur sheets are from among the first sheets of stamps printed from a finished printing plate . The actual imprimatur ( Let it be printed ) refers to the written permission of the Inland Revenue officials entered on the back of the sheet of stamps . In the 19th century , it was common for officials to remove some stamps from each sheet to present as gifts to dignitaries and other important people . Individual stamps from an Imprimatur sheet can thus be found for sale on the open market . </P> <P> A complete sheet of the Penny Black without check letters is held by the British Postal Museum . This unique item is in fact a plate proof , and by definition not an imprimatur sheet . </P> <H2> Printing ( edit ) </H2> A mint block of six , plate 11 Main article : Penny Black printing plates <P> The Penny Black was printed from 11 plates , but as Plate 1 was completely overhauled due to excessive wear , it is generally considered to be two separate plates , 1a and 1b . Plate 11 was originally intended solely for the printing of new red stamps , but a small number were printed in black . These are scarce . </P> <P> The stamps were printed in unperforated sheets , to be carefully cut with scissors for sale and use . As a result , stamps with badly cut margins , or no margins , are common and worth very little , while examples with four clear margins are rare and valuable , and fetch very high prices , especially if in mint condition . </P> <P> An original printing press for the Penny Black , the `` D '' cylinder press invented by Jacob Perkins and patented in 1819 , is on display at the British Library in London . </P> <H2> Rarity ( edit ) </H2> <P> The total print run was 286,700 sheets , containing a total of 68,808,000 stamps . Many were saved , and in used condition they remain readily available to stamp collectors . The only known complete sheets of the Penny Black are owned by the British Postal Museum . </P> <H2> The vr official ( edit ) </H2> Main article : VR official <P> In addition to the general issue of the Penny Black , a similar stamp intended for official mail was produced , with the letters `` V '' and `` R '' replacing the crosses in the top corners . Because the general public quickly accepted the postage stamps and ridiculed the Mulready stationery produced at the same time , vast supplies of Mulready letter sheets were given for official use to government departments such as the tax office and the idea of introducing an official stamp was abandoned . Only a few postally used examples exist , which probably originate from the Post Office circulars sent out as advance notice of the new stamps . Four are known on covers ; all were cut from their envelopes and then replaced . Most of the cancelled examples are from trials of cancellation types , inks , and experiments with their removal . Those trials led to the change from black to red stamps , and vice versa for the cancellations . </P> <H2> Popular culture ( edit ) </H2> The pub sign of the Penny Black pub in Oxfordshire <P> Considered a British cultural icon , the Penny Black design features in the innovations section of the new British passport in 2015 . Also in 2015 , the search engine Google marked the 175th anniversary of the postage stamp with a Google doodle of the Penny Black . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of British postage stamps </Li> <Li> List of notable postage stamps </Li> <Li> Mauritius `` Post Office '' </Li> <Li> Penny Blue </Li> <Li> Penny Red </Li> <Li> Postage stamps and postal history of Great Britain </Li> <Li> Stamp Centenary Exhibition 1940 </Li> <Li> Two penny blue </Li> <Li> Uniform Penny Post </Li> </Ul> <H2> References and sources ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> References </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Lawrence , Ken ( 1 January 1996 ) . `` Before the Penny Black ( First Series ) '' .

Rutherford directed the famous Geiger -- Marsden experiment in 1909 which suggested , upon Rutherford 's 1911 analysis , that J.J. Thomson 's plum pudding model of the atom was incorrect . Rutherford 's new model for the atom , based on the experimental results , contained the new features of a relatively high central charge concentrated into a very small volume in comparison to the rest of the atom and with this central volume also containing the bulk of the atomic mass of the atom . This region would be known as the `` nucleus '' of the atom . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Experimental basis for the model </Li> <Li> 2 Contribution to modern science </Li> <Li> 3 Symbolism </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Experimental basis for the model ( edit ) </H2> <P> Rutherford overturned Thomson 's model in 1911 with his well - known gold foil experiment in which he demonstrated that the atom has a tiny and heavy nucleus . Rutherford designed an experiment to use the alpha particles emitted by a radioactive element as probes to the unseen world of atomic structure . If Thomson was correct , the beam would go straight through the gold foil or not go through at all . Most of the beams went through the foil , but a few were reflected . </P> <P> Rutherford presented his own physical model for subatomic structure , as an interpretation for the unexpected experimental results . In it , the atom is made up of a central charge ( this is the modern atomic nucleus , though Rutherford did not use the term `` nucleus '' in his paper ) surrounded by a cloud of ( presumably ) orbiting electrons . In this May 1911 paper , Rutherford only committed himself to a small central region of very high positive or negative charge in the atom . </P> <P> For concreteness , consider the passage of a high speed α particle through an atom having a positive central charge N e , and surrounded by a compensating charge of N electrons . </P> <P> From purely energetic considerations of how far particles of known speed would be able to penetrate toward a central charge of 100 e , Rutherford was able to calculate that the radius of his gold central charge would need to be less ( how much less could not be told ) than 3.4 × 10 meters . This was in a gold atom known to be 10 meters or so in radius -- a very surprising finding , as it implied a strong central charge less than 1 / 3000th of the diameter of the atom . </P> <P> The Rutherford model served to concentrate a great deal of the atom 's charge and mass to a very small core , but did n't attribute any structure to the remaining electrons and remaining atomic mass . It did mention the atomic model of Hantaro Nagaoka , in which the electrons are arranged in one or more rings , with the specific metaphorical structure of the stable rings of Saturn . The plum pudding model of J.J. Thomson also had rings of orbiting electrons . Jean Baptiste Perrin claimed in his Nobel lecture that he was the first one to suggest the model in his paper dated 1901 . </P> <P> The Rutherford paper suggested that the central charge of an atom might be `` proportional '' to its atomic mass in hydrogen mass units u ( roughly 1 / 2 of it , in Rutherford 's model ) . For gold , this mass number is 197 ( not then known to great accuracy ) and was therefore modeled by Rutherford to be possibly 196 u . However , Rutherford did not attempt to make the direct connection of central charge to atomic number , since gold 's `` atomic number '' ( at that time merely its place number in the periodic table ) was 79 , and Rutherford had modeled the charge to be about + 100 units ( he had actually suggested 98 units of positive charge , to make half of 196 ) . Thus , Rutherford did not formally suggest the two numbers ( periodic table place , 79 , and nuclear charge , 98 or 100 ) might be exactly the same . </P> <P> A month after Rutherford 's paper appeared , the proposal regarding the exact identity of atomic number and nuclear charge was made by Antonius van den Broek , and later confirmed experimentally within two years , by Henry Moseley . </P> <P> These are the key indicators - </P> <Ul> <Li> The atom 's electron cloud does not influence alpha particle scattering . </Li> <Li> Much of an atom 's positive charge is concentrated in a relatively tiny volume at the center of the atom , known today as the nucleus . The magnitude of this charge is proportional to ( up to a charge number that can be approximately half of ) the atom 's atomic mass -- the remaining mass is now known to be mostly attributed to neutrons . This concentrated central mass and charge is responsible for deflecting both alpha and beta particles . </Li> <Li> The mass of heavy atoms such as gold is mostly concentrated in the central charge region , since calculations show it is not deflected or moved by the high speed alpha particles , which have very high momentum in comparison to electrons , but not with regard to a heavy atom as a whole . </Li> <Li> The atom itself is about 100,000 ( 10 ) times the diameter of the nucleus . This could be related to putting a grain of sand in the middle of a football field . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Contribution to modern science ( edit ) </H2> <P> After Rutherford 's discovery , scientists started to realize that the atom is not ultimately a single particle , but is made up of far smaller subatomic particles . Subsequent research determined the exact atomic structure which led to Rutherford 's gold foil experiment . Scientists eventually discovered that atoms have a positively charged nucleus ( with an exact atomic number of charges ) in the center , with a radius of about 1.2 × 10 meters × ( Atomic Mass Number ) . Electrons were found to be even smaller . </P> <P> Later , scientists found the expected number of electrons ( the same as the atomic number ) in an atom by using X-rays . When an X-ray passes through an atom , some of it is scattered while the rest passes through the atom . Since the X-ray loses its intensity primarily due to scattering at electrons , by noting the rate of decrease in X-ray intensity , the number of electrons contained in an atom can be accurately estimated . </P> <H2> Symbolism ( edit ) </H2> <P> See also Bohr model , which applies just as well to the section below . </P> Generic atomic planetary model . Shield of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission <P> Rutherford 's model deferred to the idea of many electrons in rings , per Nagaoka . However , once Niels Bohr modified this view into a picture of just a few planet - like electrons for light atoms , the Rutherford - Bohr model caught the imagination of the public . It has since continually been used as a symbol for atoms and even for `` atomic '' energy ( even though this is more properly considered nuclear energy ) . Examples of its use over the past century include but are not limited to : </P> <Ul> <Li> The logo of the United States Atomic Energy Commission , which was in part responsible for its later usage in relation to nuclear fission technology in particular . </Li> <Li> The flag of the International Atomic Energy Agency is a Rutherford atom , enclosed in olive branches . </Li> <Li> The US minor league baseball Albuquerque Isotopes ' logo is a Rutherford atom , with the electron orbits forming an A . </Li> <Li> A similar symbol , the Atomic whirl , was chosen as the symbol for the American Atheists , and has come to be used as a symbol of atheism in general . </Li> <Li> The Unicode Miscellaneous Symbols codepoint U + 269B ( ⚛ ) uses a Rutherford atom . </Li> <Li> On maps , it is generally used to indicate a nuclear power installation . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Akhlesh Lakhtakia ( Ed . ) ; Salpeter , Edwin Ε.

Written and composed by lead vocalist Bart Millard , the song , based around a main piano track , was inspired by the death of Millard 's father and considers what it would be like in Heaven and to be standing before God . The song was first issued as a track on MercyMe 's 1999 album The Worship Project , which was released on an independent record label . The song was re-recorded and included on their 2001 major - label debut album Almost There as the fifth song on the album . </P> <P> `` I Can Only Imagine '' was released in 2001 as the album 's lead single . It gained significant airplay on Christian radio formats before crossing over to mainstream radio formats such as adult contemporary and Top 40 in late 2003 and into 2004 ; to aid in promotion to these markets , a double A-side physical single ( combined with `` Word of God Speak '' ) was released in 2003 . It charted on several formats , including the Billboard Adult Contemporary ( where it peaked at No. 5 ) and the Hot 100 ( where it peaked at No. 71 ) . In 2002 , `` I Can Only Imagine '' earned the Dove Awards for ' Pop / Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year ' and ' Song of the Year ' ; Millard earned the Dove Award ' Songwriter of the Year ' at the same ceremony . With 2.5 million copies sold , it is the best - selling Christian single of all time , having been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA . As of 2018 , it is the only Christian song to reach that milestone . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Composition </Li> <Li> 3 Release and promotion </Li> <Li> 4 Impact </Li> <Li> 5 Music video </Li> <Li> 6 Reception <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Critical response </Li> <Li> 6.2 Chart performance </Li> <Li> 6.3 Awards and accolades </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Other versions </Li> <Li> 8 Track listing </Li> <Li> 9 Release history </Li> <Li> 10 Charts and certifications </Li> <Li> 11 Film adaptation </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` I Can Only Imagine '' was the debut single for United States contemporary Christian and Christian rock band MercyMe . Bart Millard , the band 's vocalist , lost his father , Arthur Wesley Millard Jr. , in 1991 . Millard was 18 at the time . Millard began writing the words `` I can only imagine '' on items when he was thinking about his father . During the recording of the band 's 1999 independent album The Worship Project , MercyMe needed one more song to fill out the album . Millard , alone on a bus in the middle of the night , finally wrote the lyrics to the song by drawing on his thoughts and personal faith about what one would experience standing before God in Heaven . Millard attests that `` ( ' I Can Only Imagine ' ) is one of the only songs I have ever written where there was n't any mistakes , it was just written the way it is and left at that '' , and estimated that it took him only ten minutes to write the lyrics . </P> <P> In writing the music for the song , however , the band faced more difficulty ; Millard noted that `` at first it was a fast song ... it was all these random ideas '' . Keyboardist Jim Bryson noted that , `` we were literally tearing down the stuff ... ( Millard ) and I were talking about arranging it differently and doing a slower version , so we just tried out a piano intro ... it was literally the first thing I played . It was n't anything to do with me , I think it was just a God thing . ( Millard ) said ' here it is , this is what 's going to happen ' , and we laid the song down in about five minutes . '' At that time , the other MercyMe members were Robby Shaffer on drums and percussion , Nathan Cochran on bass guitar and Michael Scheuchzer on guitar . This line - up recorded the first version of the song for The Worship Project . In 2006 , it was included in the ' Platinum Edition ' of Almost There . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> I Can Only Imagine A sample of `` I Can Only Imagine '' .

The song is set in the key of E major and has a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute with a vocal range from B -- G ♯ .

The song was produced by Pete Kipley , who had worked with MercyMe previously as well as with artists including Rebecca St. James , Phil Wickham and Lincoln Brewster . </P> <P> The lyrics to the song are based around the narrator wondering what it will be like in Heaven and to be standing before God . Regarding this theme , Millard explained to Fox News that `` I was always told that if he could choose , he would rather be in Heaven than here with me . As a Christian I believed that , but as an 18 - year - old it was a little hard to swallow . So the questions in the song came from me asking God what was so great about Him that my dad would rather be there . '' </P> <H2> Release and promotion ( edit ) </H2> MercyMe 's lead singer - songwriter , Bart Millard ( left ) and drummer , Robby Shaffer , performing in February 2008 . <P> `` I Can Only Imagine '' was re-recorded for their major - label debut record Almost There and released as its lead single in 2001 . The album was recorded in various locations : Ivy Park , The Indigo Room , Paradise Sound and IBC Studios . The single gained radio airplay on some contemporary Christian formats ; by November , it peaked at number - one on the Radio & Records Christian AC format and in the top twenty of the Radio & Records Christian CHR chart . </P> <P> In 2003 , a Dallas mainstream radio station , 100.3 Wild - FM , first played the song on its morning show , The Fitz Radio Program . They had responded to a caller 's repeated requests and the urgings of the program 's producer , Todd Sheppard . The song soon became the most requested and most played song on the station . After hearing the song played on the station , Millard called - in and spoke with the crew ; MercyMe then came in and played the song live . </P> <P> As other stations around the country caught on , MercyMe 's label , INO Records , partnered with Curb Records . They marketed the single to wider audiences , such as Top 40 radio . In September , INO and Curb also released a double A-side physical single , `` I Can Only Imagine / Word of God Speak '' . The latter track was co-written by Millard with the band 's producer , Kipley . Eventually , the song cracked into secular charts , including the Billboard Hot 100 and the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts . </P> <H2> Impact ( edit ) </H2> <P> MercyMe did not expect `` I Can Only Imagine '' to gain mainstream success , in part due to its explicit references to Jesus and Heaven . Millard noted that the band joked around about `` the top five songs never to cross over , and they had included `` I Can Only Imagine '' on that list . Millard also believed some radio stations were playing the song to prove it could not succeed on mainstream radio . The song had a significant effect on the band 's musical image ; in an interview , Millard commented that `` We were a rock band when we started 11 years ago . But we kind of became the ' adult contemporary poster child ' when ' I Can Only Imagine ' took off '' . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> Millard holding his father 's photograph in the music video . <P> A music video was released for `` I Can Only Imagine '' . Millard recalled the video 's inspiration : `` I just kept seeing all these people holding picture frames ( at MercyMe concerts ) that are empty because we all carry these people with us in some way . I 've had so many people after a show pull out a picture of someone they 've lost . These people embrace these photos and I just thought how can we tap into that '' . The video features everyday people as well as several music artists including Michael Tait , Tammy Trent , Bob Herdman , and Jesse Katina , each holding an empty picture frame to signify their loss of a loved one ; as the video progresses , they are holding pictures of their loved ones including Millard with his father 's photograph . </P> <P> The video opens with a shot of an empty room and a chair , shifting to show a young boy climbing up a flight of stairs . The camera then shifts to the band before returning to the boy , now in an attic which is filled with many empty picture frames . The video alternates between shots of the boy and the band before shifting to individual shots of other people , each holding an empty picture frame . As the other instruments join in , the camera comes back to the band , focusing on them before returning to shots of the people , whose picture frames now contain pictures of deceased relatives . At the end of the video , the camera returns to the boy , now running down a street with an empty frame , climaxing with him lying down in a field with the empty frame . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Critical reception for `` I Can Only Imagine '' was positive . Steve Losey of Allmusic commented that `` ( the song ) is a passionate piano - driven ballad . The song considers what it would be like to be in the presence of God . Delivered with conviction , the song is emotionally compelling '' . Jesus Freak Hideout 's reviewer Kevin Chamberlin felt `` The lyrics for the song are amazing . If you have n't listened to the lyrics , because you 're afraid of hearing pop music , get over it and listen to it . '' Kevin McNeese of NewReleaseTuesday commented that `` The definite highlight on ( Almost There ) is the worship / ballad ' I Can Only Imagine ' ... The song starts out with just piano that instantly invokes chills and builds dynamically into a powerful display of drums and guitar . But what makes the song are the lyrics , penned by Bart Millard himself . The song speaks about that day that we all dream about when we finally meet Jesus ... It 's a song that ca n't be listened to with eyes open '' . </P> <H3> Chart performance ( edit ) </H3> <P> `` I Can Only Imagine '' debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 for the chart week of 11 October 2003 at No. 76 .

They administer justice in India at a district level . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Composition of district courts </Li> <Li> 2 Appointment and removal </Li> <Li> 3 Jurisdiction </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Composition of district courts ( edit ) </H2> A court complex at Guntur <P> The highest court in each district is that of the District and Sessions Judge . This is the principal court of original civil jurisdiction besides the High Court of the State and which derives its jurisdiction in civil matters primarily from the code of civil procedure . The district court is also a court of Sessions when it exercises its jurisdiction on criminal matters under the Code of Criminal procedure . The district court is presided over by one District Judge appointed by the state Governor with on the advice of state chief justice In addition to the district judge there may be a number of Additional District Judges and Assistant District Judges depending on the workload . The Additional District Judge and the court presided have equivalent jurisdiction as the District Judge and his district court . </P> <P> However , the district judge has supervisory control over Additional and Assistant District Judges , including decisions on the allocation of work among them . The District and Sessions judge is often referred to as `` district judge '' when he presides over civil matters and `` sessions judge '' when he presides over criminal matters . Being the highest judge at district level , the District Judge also enjoys the power to manage the state funds allocated for the development of judiciary in the district . </P> <P> The district judge is also called `` metropolitan session judge '' when he is presiding over a district court in a city which is designated `` metropolitan area '' by the state . Other courts subordinated to district court in the metropolitan area are also referred to with `` metropolitan '' prefixed to the usual designation . An area is designated a metropolitan area by the concerned state Government if population of the area exceeds one million or more than that . </P> <H2> Appointment and removal ( edit ) </H2> <P> The judges of subordinate courts are appointed by the Governor in consultation with the chief justice of the High Court of the concerned State . A minimum of seven years of practise as a lawyer at bar is a necessary qualification for direct entry level to become a District Judge upon a written examination and oral interview by a committee of High court judges , the appointment of district judges is notified by the state Government . This is referred to as direct recruitment . District judges are also appointed by way of elevation of judges from courts subordinate to district courts provided they fulfill the minimum years of service but unfortunately the entry level district judge exams have caused the judges on the lower rungs of the Judiciary to become lax as their chances of filling up posts for the work they had done may never fructify to promotions because of posts later being filled up by lawyers directly becoming district judges . </P> <P> The next level of ascendancy for a district judge who served sufficient number of years is the post of High court judge . High court Judges are usually appointed from a pool of advocates practicing at the Bar of the High court and District Judges who served for sufficient number of years . This has also caused District Judges to wane in their efficiency as they have come to realize that elevation of lawyers directly to High Court Judges dampens their process of being awarded with promotions for the work they 've put in over many years of service . </P> <P> A district judge or Additional judge may be removed from his office by the governor on conformation from the high court collegiam . </P> <H2> Jurisdiction ( edit ) </H2> <P> The District Court or Additional District court exercises jurisdiction both on original side and appellate side in civil and criminal matters arising in the District . The territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction in civil matters is usually set in concerned state enactments on the subject of civil courts . On the criminal side , jurisdiction is exclusively derived from the criminal procedure code . As per this code the maximum sentence a Sessions Judge of district court may award to a convict is capital punishment . </P> <P> The district court has appellate jurisdiction over all subordinate courts situated in the district on both civil and criminal matters . Subordinate courts , on the civil side ( in ascending order ) are , Junior Civil Judge ( JCJ ) Court , Principal Junior Civil Judge Court , Senior Civil Judge Court ( also called sub-court ) . Subordinate courts , on the criminal side ( in ascending order ) are , Second Class Judicial Magistrate Court , First Class Judicial Magistrate Court , Chief Judicial Magistrate Court . </P> <P> Certain matters on criminal side or civil side can not be tried by a lesser court than a district court . This gives the District Court original jurisdiction in such matters . </P> <P> Appeals from the district courts lie to the High Court of the concerned state . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> District Munsiff Court </Li> <Li> Sessions Court </Li> <Li> Delhi District Courts </Li> <Li> Nyaya Panchayat </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` District Courts of India - official website '' .

They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land . Lennie 's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet rabbits on the farm , as he loves touching soft animals , although he always kills them . This dream is one of Lennie 's favorite stories , which George constantly retells . They had fled from Weed after Lennie touched a young woman 's dress and would n't let go , leading to an accusation of rape . It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie 's protector , despite his antics . </P> <P> After being hired at a farm , the pair are confronted by Curley -- The Boss 's small , aggressive son with a Napoleon complex who dislikes larger men , and starts to target Lennie . Curley 's flirtatious and provocative wife , to whom Lennie is instantly attracted , poses a problem as well . In contrast , the pair also meets Candy , an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog , and Slim , an intelligent and gentle jerkline - skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies . Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy , whose loyal , accomplished sheep dog was put down by fellow ranch - hand Carlson . </P> <P> In spite of problems , their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month , in return for permission to live with them . The trio are ecstatic , but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie , who defends himself by easily crushing Curley 's fist while urged on by George . </P> <P> Nevertheless , George feels more relaxed , to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands . Lennie wanders into the stable , and chats with Crooks , the bitter , yet educated stable buck , who is isolated from the other workers racially . Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks , who can not resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility . Curley 's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men , especially Lennie . However , her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and threatens Crooks to have him lynched . </P> <P> The next day , Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it . Curley 's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie , admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed , revealing her personality . After finding out about Lennie 's habit , she offers to let him stroke her hair , but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength . Lennie becomes frightened , and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away . When the other ranch hands find the corpse , George realizes that their dream is at an end . George hurries to find Lennie , hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble . </P> <P> George meets Lennie at the place , their camping spot before they came to the ranch . The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the dream , knowing it is something they 'll never share . He then shoots and kills Lennie , with Curley , Slim , and Carlson arriving seconds after . Only Slim realizes what happened , and consolingly leads him away . Curley and Carlson look on , unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men . </P> <H2> Characters </H2> I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell . I worked in the same country that the story is laid in . The characters are composites to a certain extent . Lennie was a real person . He 's in an insane asylum in California right now . I worked alongside him for many weeks . He did n't kill a girl . He killed a ranch foreman . Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach . I hate to tell you how many times I saw him do it . We could n't stop him until it was too late . <P> John Steinbeck , interview by The New York Times , 1937 </P> <Ul> <Li> George Milton : A quick - witted man who is Lennie 's guardian and best friend . His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future . He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young . He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as `` small and quick , '' every part of him being `` defined , '' with small strong hands on slender arms . He has a dark face and `` restless eyes '' and `` sharp , strong features '' including a `` thin , bony nose . '' </Li> <Li> Lennie Small : A mentally disabled , but physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion . He dreams of `` living off the fatta ' the lan ' '' and being able to tend to rabbits . His love for soft things conspires against him , mostly because he does not know his own strength , and eventually becomes his undoing . Steinbeck defines his appearance as George 's `` opposite , '' writing that he is a `` huge man , shapeless of face , with large , pale eyes '' and `` wide , sloping shoulders . '' Lennie walks heavily , dragging his feet a little , `` the way a bear drags his paws , '' adding that his arms do not swing at his sides , but hang loosely . </Li> <Li> Candy : An aging ranch handyman , Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch . Fearing that his age is making him useless , he seizes on George 's description of the farm he and Lennie will have , offering his life 's savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land . </Li> <Li> Slim : A `` jerkline skinner , '' the main driver of a mule team and the `` prince of the ranch '' . Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect . His insight , intuition , kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him , and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie . </Li> <Li> Curley : The Boss ' son , a young , pugnacious character , once a semi-professional boxer . He is described by others , with some irony , as `` handy '' , partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with vaseline on his left hand . He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie . At one point , Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him , and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him . </Li> <Li> Curley 's wife : A young , pretty woman , who is mistrusted by her husband . The other characters refer to her only as `` Curley 's wife '' . Steinbeck explained that she is `` not a person , she 's a symbol . She has no function , except to be a foil -- and a danger to Lennie . '' Curley 's wife 's preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death : She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence , only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him ' mussing it ' . Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually , and accidentally , kills her by breaking her neck . </Li> <Li> Crooks : Crooks , the black stable - hand , gets his name from his crooked back . Proud , bitter , and cynical , he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin . Despite himself , Crooks becomes fond of Lennie , and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land , he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden . </Li> <Li> Candy 's dog : A blind dog who is described as `` old '' , `` stinky '' , and `` crippled '' , and is killed by Carlson . </Li> <Li> Carlson : A `` thick bodied '' ranch hand , he kills Candy 's dog with little sympathy . </Li> <Li> The Boss : Curley 's father , the superintendent of the ranch . The ranch is owned by `` a big land company '' according to Candy . </Li> <Li> Whit : A young ranch hand . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Themes </H2> <P> In every bit of honest writing in the world there is a base theme . Try to understand men , if you understand each other you will be kind to each other . Knowing a man well never leads to hate and nearly always leads to love . There are shorter means , many of them . There is writing promoting social change , writing punishing injustice , writing in celebration of heroism , but always that base theme . Try to understand each other . </P> -- John Steinbeck in his 1938 journal entry <P> Steinbeck emphasizes dreams throughout the book . George aspires to independence , to be his own boss , to have a homestead , and most importantly to be `` somebody '' . Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead , and to quench his fixation on soft objects . Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog , and for security for his old age -- on George 's homestead . Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self - respect , security , and most of all , acceptance . Curley 's wife dreams to be an actress , to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley , and an end to her loneliness . </P> <P> Loneliness is a significant factor in several characters ' lives . Candy is lonely after his dog is gone . Curley 's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for -- she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch , which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy . The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness . Crooks states the theme candidly as `` A guy goes nuts if he ai n't got anybody . Do n't make any difference who the guy is , long 's he 's with you . '' The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of Soledad , which means `` solitude '' in Spanish . </P> <P> Despite the need for companionship , Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another . The loneliness of Curley 's wife is upheld by Curley 's jealousy , which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her . Crooks 's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the stable ; his bitterness is partially broken , however , through Lennie 's ignorance . </P> <P> Steinbeck 's characters are often powerless , due to intellectual , economic , and social circumstances . Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character , which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand . However , his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness . Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression . As George , Candy and Crooks are positive , action - oriented characters , they wish to purchase a homestead , but because of the Depression , they are unable to generate enough money . Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself , but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek . Since they can not do so , the real danger of Lennie 's mental handicap comes to the fore . </P> <P> Regarding human interaction , evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley 's wife . Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father 's farm . He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife . Curley 's Napoleon complex is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents . Curley 's wife , on the other hand , is not physically but verbally manipulative . She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention , flirting with the farm hands . According to the Penguin Teacher 's Guide for Of Mice and Men , Curley and Curley 's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways . </P> <P> Fate is felt most heavily as the characters ' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie ( who is a real danger ) . Steinbeck presents this as `` something that happened '' or as his friend coined for him `` non-teleological thinking '' or `` is thinking '' , which postulates a non-judgmental point of view . </P> <H2> Development </H2> <P> Of Mice and Men was Steinbeck 's first attempt at writing in the form of novel - play termed a `` play - novelette '' by one critic . Structured in three acts of two chapters each , it is intended to be both a novella and a script for a play . It is only 30,000 words in length . Steinbeck wanted to write a novel that could be played from its lines , or a play that could be read like a novel . </P> <P> Steinbeck originally titled it Something That Happened ( referring to the events of the book as `` something that happened '' because nobody can be really blamed for the tragedy that unfolds in the story ) . However , he changed the title after reading Robert Burns 's poem To a Mouse . Burns 's poem tells of the regret the narrator feels for having destroyed the home of a mouse while plowing his field . </P> <P> Steinbeck wrote this book and The Grapes of Wrath in what is now Monte Sereno , California . An early draft of Of Mice and Men was eaten by Steinbeck 's dog , named Max . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> <P> Attaining the greatest positive response of any of his works up to that time , Steinbeck 's novella was chosen as a Book of the Month Club selection before it was published . Praise for the work came from many notable critics , including Maxine Garrard ( Enquirer - Sun ) , Christopher Morley , and Harry Thornton Moore ( New Republic ) . New York Times critic Ralph Thompson described the novella as a `` grand little book , for all its ultimate melodrama . '' </P> <P> The novella has been banned from various US public and school libraries or curricula for allegedly `` promoting euthanasia '' , `` condoning racial slurs '' , being `` anti-business '' , containing profanity , and generally containing `` vulgar '' and `` offensive language '' . Many of the bans and restrictions have been lifted and it remains required reading in many other American , Australian , Irish , British , New Zealand and Canadian high schools . As a result of being a frequent target of censors , Of Mice and Men appears on the American Library Association 's list of the Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century ( number 4 ) . In the UK , it was listed at number 52 of the `` nation 's best loved novels '' on the BBC 's 2003 survey The Big Read . Of Mice and Men has been challenged 54 times since it was published in 1936 . However , scholars like Thomas Scarseth have fought to protect the book by citing its literary value . According to Scarseth `` in true great literature the pain of Life is transmuted into the beauty of Art '' , . The book was once studied in English Literature GCSE , but was dropped because it did n't originate from England . </P> <H2> Adaptations </H2> See also : Of Mice and Men in popular culture <H3> Stage </H3> Main articles : Of Mice and Men ( play ) and Of Mice and Men ( opera ) <P> The first stage production was written by Steinbeck , produced by Sam H. Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman . It opened on November 23 , 1937 , in the Music Box Theatre on Broadway . Running for 207 performances , it starred Wallace Ford as George and Broderick Crawford as Lennie . The role of Crooks was performed by Leigh Whipper , the first African - American member of the Actors ' Equity Association . Whipper repeated this role in the 1939 film version . </P> <P> The production was chosen as Best Play in 1938 by the New York Drama Critics ' Circle . </P> <P> In 1939 the production was moved to Los Angeles , still with Wallace Ford in the role of George , but with Lon Chaney , Jr. , taking on the role of Lennie . Chaney 's performance in the role resulted in his casting in the movie . </P> <P> The play was revived in a 1974 Broadway production in the Brooks Atkinson Theatre starring Kevin Conway as George and James Earl Jones as Lennie . Noted stage actress Pamela Blair played Curley 's Wife in this production . </P> <P> In 1970 Carlisle Floyd wrote an opera based on this novella . One departure between Steinbeck 's book and Floyd 's opera is that the opera features The Ballad Singer , a character not found in the book . </P> <P> A new version of the play opened on Broadway at The Longacre Theater on March 19 , 2014 for a limited 18 - week engagement , starring James Franco , Chris O'Dowd , Leighton Meester and Jim Norton . </P> <H3> Film </H3> Poster for the 1939 film <P> The first adaptation was in 1939 , two years after the publication of the novella , and starred Lon Chaney Jr. as Lennie , with Burgess Meredith as George , and was directed by Lewis Milestone . It was nominated for four Academy Awards . </P> <P> A TV version , produced by David Susskind in 1968 , starred George Segal as George , Nicol Williamson as Lennie , Will Geer as Candy , Moses Gunn as Crooks , and Don Gordon and Joey Heatherton as Curley and his wife . </P> <P> A 1972 Iranian film , Topoli , directed by Reza Mirlohi was adapted from and dedicated to John Steinbeck and his story . </P> <P> In 1981 a TV movie version was made , starring Randy Quaid as Lennie , and Robert Blake as George , and directed by Reza Badiyi . </P> <P> Another theatrical film version was made in 1992 , directed by Gary Sinise , who was nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes . Sinise also played George in the film , and the role of Lennie was played by John Malkovich . For this adaptation , both men reprised their roles from the 1980 Steppenwolf Theatre Company production . </P> <P> The 1992 Malayalam film Soorya Manasam directed by Viji Thampi is also based on the novel . </P> <H3> Radio </H3> <P> Of Mice and Men was adapted by Donna Franceschild as a radio play directed by Kirsty Williams starring David Tennant broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 7 March 2010 . </P> <H2> References </H2> <H3> Notes </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Of Mice and Men Key Facts on Sparknotes </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Who , what , why : Why do children study Of Mice and Men ? on BBC </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Stephen Maunder ( March 25 , 2011 ) . `` Who , what , why : Why do children study Of Mice and Men ?

It is a sequel to the 1997 film Kiss the Girls , with Morgan Freeman reprising his role as detective Alex Cross . The screenplay by Marc Moss was adapted from the 1993 novel of the same title by James Patterson , but many of the key plot elements of the book were controversially eliminated . The movie received negative to mixed critical reviews , although it became a box office success . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot summary </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Writing </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Box office </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4.3 Awards and nominations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Series reboot </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> After Washington , D.C. detective , forensic psychologist and author Alex Cross ( Morgan Freeman ) loses control of a sting operation , resulting in the death of his partner , he opts to retire from the force . He finds himself drawn back to police work when Megan Rose ( Mika Boorem ) , the daughter of a United States senator , is kidnapped from her exclusive private school by computer science teacher Gary Soneji ( Michael Wincott ) . US Secret Service Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan ( Monica Potter ) , held responsible for the breach in security , joins forces with Cross to find the missing girl . </P> <P> Soneji contacts Cross by phone and alerts him to the fact one of Megan 's sneakers is in the detective 's mailbox , proving Soneji is the kidnapper . Cross deduces the man is obsessed with the 1932 Charles A. Lindbergh Jr. kidnapping and hopes to become as infamous as Bruno Hauptmann by committing a new `` Crime of the Century '' which might be discussed by Cross in one of his true crime books . Megan 's kidnapping proves to be only part of Soneji 's real plan : to kidnap Dimitri Starodubov ( Anton Yelchin ) , the son of the Russian president , guaranteeing himself greater infamy . </P> <P> After Cross and Flannigan foil his second kidnapping plot , a supposed call from the kidnapper demands Cross deliver a ransom of $10 million in diamonds by following an intricate maze of calls made to public phone booths scattered throughout the city . Cross ultimately tosses the gems out the window of a rapidly moving Metro train to a figure standing by the tracks . Soneji later arrives at Flannigan 's home and confronts Cross after disabling Flannigan with a taser , the detective realizes the kidnapper is unaware of the ransom demand and delivery . Soneji tries to leave with Flannigan , but Cross kills him . </P> <P> Cross becomes suspicious and realizes someone discovered Soneji long before his plot came to fruition . After searching Flannigan 's personal computer , he finds enough evidence to prove Flannigan and her fellow Secret Service agent Ben Devine ( Billy Burke ) used Soneji as a pawn in their own plot . He tracks them down to a secluded farmhouse where Flannigan has murdered Devine and is now intent on eliminating Megan Rose . Cross saves Megan and shoots Flannigan in the heart , killing her . Afterwards , Cross takes Megan back to her parents . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross </Li> <Li> Monica Potter as Jezzie Flannigan </Li> <Li> Michael Wincott as Gary Soneji / The Spider </Li> <Li> Dylan Baker as Ollie McArthur </Li> <Li> Mika Boorem as Megan Rose </Li> <Li> Billy Burke as Ben Devine </Li> <Li> Anton Yelchin as Dimitri Starodubov </Li> <Li> Jay O. Sanders as Kyle Craig </Li> <Li> Michael Moriarty as Senator Hank Rose </Li> <Li> Penelope Ann Miller as Elizabeth Rose </Li> <Li> Anna Maria Horsford as Vickie </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Writing ( edit ) </H3> <P> One of the primary elements of the book screenwriter Marc Moss eliminated from his script was the fact that Soneji is actually a mild - mannered suburban husband and father suffering from dissociative identity disorder resulting from having been abused as a child . After a lengthy trial for kidnapping and several murders not included in the film , he is found guilty but remanded to a mental institution to serve his sentence . Also missing from the film is a romantic relationship shared by Cross and Jezzie , her trial and eventual execution by lethal injection , and the discovery of Megan ( Maggie as she is known in the book ) , hidden away with a native Bolivian family near the Andes Mountains , two years after her kidnapping . </P> <P> A few other minor differences from the original book include : Dimitri ( Michael `` Shrimpie '' Goldberg as referred to in the book ) being kidnapped at the same time as Megan ( Maggie ) ; Megan 's ( Maggie 's ) mother was the more famous of her parents , being a popular actress ; when the children are kidnapped they are sprayed with chloroform spray . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Box office receipts totaled US $ 105,178,561 , of which $74,078,174 was from the United States having earned US $16,712,407 in its opening weekend at 2,530 theaters . </P> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> The film received mixed to negative reviews and has a `` rotten '' rating of 32 % on Rotten Tomatoes . </P> <P> Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called the film an `` overplotted , hollow thriller , which crams in so much exposition that characters speak in fetid hunks for what seems like minutes at a time ... But Spider could n't be better served than it is by Mr. Freeman , whose prickly smarts and silken impatience bring believability to a classless , underdeveloped thriller ... Still , he is wasted in this impersonal , almost inept thriller . '' </P> <P> Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film a mixed 2 stars out of a possible 4 . He wrote : `` A few loopholes I can forgive . But when a plot is riddled with them , crippled by them , made implausible by them , as in Along Came a Spider , I get distracted . I 'm wondering , since Dr. Alex Cross is so brilliant , how come he does n't notice yawning logical holes in the very fabric of the story he 's occupying ? ... The film contains two kinds of loopholes : ( 1 ) Those that emerge when you think back on the plot , and ( 2 ) Those that seem like loopholes at the time , and then are explained by later developments that may contain loopholes of their own ... There are places in this movie you just ca n't get to from other places in this movie . '' Nonetheless , Ebert thought that Freeman 's performance made Cross an intriguing character , even when the plot was verging on the nonsensical . </P> <P> Robert Koehler of Variety felt `` the very characteristics that have made Cross so appealing , particularly his mind - tickling abilities to assess and outmaneuver his criminal opponents , are reduced here to the most fundamental and predictable level ... As reliable as any actor in Hollywood , Freeman delivers the requisite gravitas , but the bland script curtails any personal touches he might have inserted were his sleuth character unraveling a truly vexing mystery . '' </P> <P> However , critic Harvey O'Brian weighed in with the sentiment that `` Unlike , for example , the overblown kidnap movie Ransom , Along Came a Spider plays down its sensational elements . It favours the procedural aspects of Cross ' investigation which , though infected with the usual ' Eureka ' factor of brilliant discoveries by the leading man at regular intervals just when it looked like he was stumped , are largely delivered with sincerity . Freeman has such a strong grip on this kind of determined , middle aged , everyman character by now that he can easily take the audience along for the ride . The film itself is otherwise sincere in general , with no real attempt at smarmy black humour or winks to the audience . It draws you in to a ( relatively ) realistic depiction of a tense situation in which people behave less like action heroes and more like human beings . '' </P> <P> Compuserve 's Harvey Karten argued , `` Some critics will tell you that despite Lee Tamahori 's overplotting of Marc Moss 's adaptation of James Patterson 's novel , Along Came a Spider is one of those thrillers that allow you to check your brains at the door . Not true . Did the journalists all go for popcorn when Detective Alex Cross and Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan ( nice spelling ) engaged first in a discussion of psychology and then of philosophy ? This may have been Phil 101 , but imagine the interest that must have been aroused in the audience with a product placement for university education . Says Cross in discussing what makes us choose our careers : ' You do what you are . ' ' Not so , ' replies Jezzie , every hair in place , not one gram of makeup disturbed , despite the excitement of the discussion ... ' You are what you do . ' '' </P> <H3> Awards and nominations ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jerry Goldsmith won the BMI Film & TV Award for his original score , and Morgan Freeman was nominated for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture but lost to Denzel Washington for Training Day . </P> <H2> Series reboot ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Alex Cross ( film ) <P> There were no further sequels , but the character of Alex Cross was rebooted with a 2012 film adaptation of the novel Cross under the title Alex Cross starring Tyler Perry in the titular role . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of American films of 2001 </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alongcameaspider.htm </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alongcameaspider.htm </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Along Came a Spider '' .

The Americas were incorporated into the Spanish Empire , with the exception of Brazil and Canada , and the crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region . The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the Catholic faith through indigenous conversions . </P> <P> Beginning with the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries , the Spanish Empire would expand across the Caribbean Islands , half of South America , most of Central America and much of North America ( including present day Mexico , Florida and the Southwestern and Pacific Coastal regions of the United States ) . It is estimated that during the colonial period ( 1492 -- 1832 ) , a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era ( 1850 -- 1950 ) ; the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century , and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty . </P> <P> Spain enjoyed a cultural golden age in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars . Spanish wars of conquest included laying waste much of the Netherlands and a disastrous attempt to invade England . </P> <P> In the early 19th century , the Spanish American wars of independence resulted in the emancipation of most Spanish colonies in the Americas , except for Cuba and Puerto Rico , which were finally given up in 1898 , following the Spanish -- American War , together with Guam and the Philippines in the Pacific . Spain 's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Conquests <Ul> <Li> 1.1 West Indies </Li> <Li> 1.2 Mexico </Li> <Li> 1.3 Peru </Li> <Li> 1.4 Río de la Plata and Paraguay </Li> <Li> 1.5 New Granada </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Governance <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Dominions <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 North America , Central America </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 South America </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 19th century <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Demographic impact </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 Bibliography <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Historiography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Conquests ( edit ) </H2> Iberian territory of Crown of Castile ... Overseas north territory of Crown of Castile ( New Spain and Philippines ) Overseas south territory of Crown of Castile ( Perú , New Granada and Río de la Plata ) <P> The Catholic Monarchs Isabella of Castile , Queen of Castile and her husband King Ferdinand , King of Aragon , pursued a policy of joint rule of their kingdoms and created a single Spanish monarchy . Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs , they remained separate kingdoms . The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus for a voyage to reach India by sailing West . The funding came from the queen of Castile , so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile . In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories , authority for expeditions of discovery , conquest , and settlement resided in the monarchy . </P> <H3> West Indies ( edit ) </H3> <P> Columbus made four voyages to the West Indies as the monarchs granted Columbus the governorship of the new territories , and financed more of his trans - Atlantic journeys . He founded La Navidad on the island later named Hispaniola ( now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , in what is the present - day Haiti on his first voyage . After its destruction by the indigenous Taino people , the town of Isabella was begun in 1493 , on his second voyage . In 1496 his brother , Bartholomew , founded Santo Domingo . By 1500 , despite a high death rate , there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area . The local Taíno people continued to resist , refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish - occupied villages . The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest . In 1500 the city of Nueva Cádiz was founded on the island of Cubagua , Venezuela , followed by the founding of Santa Cruz by Alonso de Ojeda in present - day Guajira peninsula . Cumaná in Venezuela was the first permanent settlement founded by Europeans in the mainland Americas , in 1501 by Franciscan friars , but due to successful attacks by the indigenous people , it had to be refounded several times , until Diego Hernández de Serpa 's foundation in 1569 . The Spanish founded San Sebastian de Uraba in 1509 but abandoned it within the year . There is indirect evidence that the first permanent Spanish mainland settlement established in the Americas was Santa María la Antigua del Darién . </P> <H3> Mexico ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Spanish conquest of Mexico Further information : Spanish conquest of Yucatán and Spanish conquest of Guatemala Spanish Conquest of Mexico , meeting of Cortés and Moctezuma II Map depicting Cortes ' invasion route <P> The Spanish conquest of Mexico is generally understood to be the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire ( 1519 -- 21 ) which was the base for later conquests of other regions . Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs . The Spanish conquest of Yucatán , the Spanish conquest of Guatemala , the war of Mexico 's west , and the Chichimeca War in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations . But not until the Spanish conquest of Peru was the conquest of the Aztecs matched in scope by the victory over the Inca empire in 1532 . </P> <P> The Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire was led by Hernán Cortés . The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick , from 1519 to 1521 , and aided by his Tlaxcala and other allies from indigenous city - states or altepetl . These polities allied against the Aztec empire , to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest , leaving the city - states ' political hierarchy and social structure in place . </P> <P> The Spanish conquest of Yucatán was a much longer campaign , from 1551 to 1697 , against the Maya peoples in the Yucatán Peninsula of present - day Mexico and northern Central America . Hernán Cortés ' landing ashore at present day Veracruz and founding the Spanish city there on April 22 , 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region . The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade , with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain . Established by Charles V in 1535 , the first viceroy was Don Antonio de Mendoza . </P> <P> Spain colonized and exerted control of Alta California through the Spanish missions in California until the Mexican secularization act of 1833 . </P> <H3> Peru ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire Vasco Núñez de Balboa claiming possession of the South Sea ( Pacific Ocean ) Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco <P> In 1532 at the Battle of Cajamarca a group of Spaniards under Francisco Pizarro and their indigenous Andean Indian auxiliaries native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor Atahualpa of the Inca Empire . It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest empire in the Americas . In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the Inca civilization . </P> <P> The Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor Atahualpa and Huáscar , and the enmity of indigenous nations the Incas had subjugated , such as the Huancas , Chachapoyas , and Cañaris . In the following years the conquistadors and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region . The Viceroyalty of Perú was established in 1542 . The last Inca stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572 . </P> <H3> Río de la Plata and Paraguay ( edit ) </H3> <P> European explorers arrived in Río de la Plata in 1516 . Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the Fort of Sancti Spiritu established in 1527 next to the Paraná River . Buenos Aires , a permanent colony , was established in 1536 and in 1537 Asunción was established in the area that is now Paraguay . Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away , and in 1541 the site was abandoned . A second ( and permanent ) settlement was established in 1580 by Juan de Garay , who arrived by sailing down the Paraná River from Asunción ( now the capital of Paraguay ) . He dubbed the settlement `` Santísima Trinidad '' and its port became `` Puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires . '' The city came to be the head of the Governorate of the Río de la Plata and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . </P> <H3> New Granada ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Spanish conquest of the Muisca See also : Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations <P> Between 1537 and 1543 , six Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia , conquered the Muisca Confederation , and set up the New Kingdom of Granada ( Spanish : Nuevo Reino de Granada ) . Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada was the leading conquistador with his brother Hernán second in command . It was governed by the president of the Audiencia of Bogotá , and comprised an area corresponding mainly to modern - day Colombia and parts of Venezuela . The conquistadors originally organized it as a captaincy general within the Viceroyalty of Peru . The crown established the audiencia in 1549 . Ultimately , the kingdom became part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada first in 1717 and permanently in 1739 . After several attempts to set up independent states in the 1810s , the kingdom and the viceroyalty ceased to exist altogether in 1819 with the establishment of Gran Colombia . </P> <H2> Governance ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Spanish Empire , Viceroyalty of New Spain , Viceroyalty of Peru , and Intendant § The Spanish Monarchy Argentine Cabildo council <P> Spain 's administration of its colonies in the Americas was divided into the Viceroyalty of New Spain 1535 ( capital , Mexico City ) , and the Viceroyalty of Peru 1542 ( capital , Lima ) . In the 18th century the additional Viceroyalty of New Granada 1717 ( capital , Bogotá ) , and Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata 1776 ( capital , Buenos Aires ) were established from portions of the Viceroyalty of Peru . The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires . </P> <P> The system of crown rule evolved from the era of the Catholic Monarchs , which established the Council of the Indies , to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Hapsburg era , and then into an Intendant system in the eighteenth century as part of the Bourbon Reforms . The reform was aimed at increasing crown control over its colonies , raising more revenue , and promoting greater efficiency . </P> <H3> Dominions ( edit ) </H3> Juan Ponce de León ( Santervás de Campos , Valladolid , Spain ) led the first European expedition to Florida , which he named .

The Libertadores ( Spanish and Portuguese for `` Liberators '' ) were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence . They were predominantly criollos ( Americas - born people of European ancestry , mostly Spanish or Portuguese ) , bourgeois and influenced by liberalism and in some cases with military training in the mother country . </P> <P> In 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the Viceroyalty of New Granada . The first two were in present - day Bolivia at Sucre ( May 25 ) , and La Paz ( July 16 ) ; and the third in present - day Ecuador at Quito ( August 10 ) . In 1810 Mexico declared independence , with the Mexican War of Independence following for over a decade . In 1821 Treaty of Córdoba established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War . The Plan of Iguala was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico . </P> <P> These began a movement for colonial independence that spread to Spain 's other colonies in the Americas . The ideas from the French and the American Revolution influenced the efforts . All of the colonies , except Cuba and Puerto Rico , attained independence by the 1820s . The British Empire offered support , wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas . </P> <P> In 1898 , the United States achieved victory in the Spanish -- American War with Spain , ending the Spanish colonial era . Spanish possession and rule of its remaining colonies in the Americas ended in that year with its sovereignty transferred to the United States . The United States took occupation of Cuba , the Philippines , and Puerto Rico . Puerto Rico continues to be a possession of the United States , now officially continues as a self - governing unincorporated territory . </P> <H3> Demographic impact ( edit ) </H3> <P> It has been estimated that over 1.86 million Spaniards emigrated to Latin America in the period between 1492 and 1824 , with millions more continuing to immigrate following independence . </P> <P> In Hispaniola , the indigenous Taíno pre-contact population before the arrival of Columbus of several hundred thousand had declined to sixty thousand by 1509 . Although population estimates vary , Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas , the `` Defender of the Indians '' estimated there were 6 million ( 6,000,000 ) Taíno and Arawak in the Caribbean at the time of Columbus 's arrival in 1492 . </P> <P> The population of the Native Amerindian population in Mexico declined by an estimated 90 % ( reduced to 1 -- 2.5 million people ) by the early 17th century . In Peru the indigenous Amerindian pre-contact population of around 6.5 million declined to 1 million by the early 17th century . The overwhelming cause of the decline in both Mexico and Peru was infectious diseases , although the brutality of the Encomienda also played a significant part in the population decline . </P> <P> Of the history of the indigenous population of California , Sherburne F. Cook ( 1896 -- 1974 ) was the most painstakingly careful researcher . From decades of research he made estimates for the pre-contact population and the history of demographic decline during the Spanish and post-Spanish periods . According to Cook , the indigenous Californian population at first contact , in 1769 , was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910 . The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period , during the Mexican and US periods of Californian history ( 1821 -- 1910 ) , with the most dramatic collapse ( 200,000 to 25,000 ) occurring in the US period ( 1846 -- 1910 ) . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> New Spain portal </Li> <Li> Colombia portal </Li> <Li> Argentina portal </Li> <Li> Ecuador portal </Li> <Li> Venezuela portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Atlantic World </Li> <Li> Historiography of Colonial Spanish America </Li> <Li> Black Legend </Li> <Li> Habsburg Spain </Li> <Li> Inter caetera </Li> <Li> List of largest empires </Li> <Li> New Spain </Li> <Li> Old Spanish Trail ( trade route ) </Li> <Li> Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas </Li> <Li> Smallpox Epidemics in the New World </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of Chiapas </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of El Salvador </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of Guatemala </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of Honduras </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of Petén </Li> <Li> Spanish conquest of the Maya </Li> <Li> Timeline of imperialism # Colonization of North America </Li> <Li> Valladolid debate </Li> <Li> Viceroyalty of Peru </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Ida Altman , S.L.

The second factor was disease ... A third factor , which strongly intensified the effect of the other two , was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian . He was driven from his home by the thousands , starved , beaten , raped , and murdered with impunity . He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases , but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food , clothing , and shelter . The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible , and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident . '' Cook , Sherburne F. 1976b .

A louder buzzer indicates the third judge 's button was pressed , and the contestant 's performance is terminated . Then , the judges deliberate over the act and decide if it gets through to the live semi-finals . In the semi-finals , the judges have X 's ( red buttons ) and check marks ( white buttons ) . Acts are divided into four groups of either 14 or 15 , and only 10 of those acts in the group perform . They do not have the power to terminate an act in the middle of his / her performance . At the end of the performance , the judges give the act a check for approval , and an X if they did not like the act . At the end of the episode , the judges would pick an act and automatically move them through to the live finale . Then , the viewers at home would vote another act through to the finale . The act with the most votes from the viewers would move on to the finals and that act would be announced in a live results show the next day . There was also a fifth wild card episode , where the judges picked ten acts who were previously eliminated and give them one more chance to perform . In the finale , there is no judges ' choice , and the voting is entirely handed over to the viewers . </P> <H2> Auditions </H2> <H3> Los Angeles auditions </H3> <Dl> <Dd> Aired June 21 , 2006 , 2 hours </Dd> </Dl> <P> Acts that advanced to the second round include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Bobby Badfingers , a `` professional finger snappist '' from San Francisco , California . He danced to classic 1950s rock , as well . </Li> <Li> Dave the Horn Guy , a man with a plethora of horns attached to his body . He moved different parts of his body to honk the horns , making humorous music . </Li> <Li> At Last , a hip - hop a cappella quartet . </Li> <Li> Kenny Shelton , a juggler from Alpine , California , who was given three Xs for dropping his props , and pleaded for another chance . He survived the first round by successfully juggling three swords on top of a Rola Bola for one minute . </Li> <Li> Bernie Barker , a 65 - year - old male stripper from San Diego . Morgan did not like the act , but Brandy and Hasselhoff voted him through , with Brandy saying she could use him as a backup dancer for her next music video . </Li> <Li> Alexis Jordan , a 14 - year - old R&B singer . All three judges had agreed that she had a ' perfect voice ' . She performed the Whitney Houston song `` I Have Nothing '' . </Li> <Li> Kevin Johnson , a ventriloquist who threw his voice and the voices of his two puppets out of synchronization with lip movements , à la the English - language dub of Godzilla .

His buzz was later withdrawn . </Li> <Li> Vladimir Malachikhin , a hand balancing acrobat . </Li> <Li> Team AcroDunk , a group of acrobats from Houston , Texas , who shot basketballs while doing somersaults , backflips , and other tricks on a trampoline .

Brandy and Hasselhoff gave their total praise for them though . </Li> <Li> Ivan Pecel , a juggler . He did some technical juggling , which did not impress Hasselhoff or Morgan , though Brandy supported him . Morgan reluctantly voted yes on the condition that Ivan step up his performance in the semifinals . </Li> <Li> Nathan Burton , a magician who performed the Bowl - A-Rama magic trick , making a bowling ball appear from a drawing in a large sketchpad . Then , he did a disappearing act involving the `` Microwave of Death '' . Morgan voted `` no , '' but was passed through to the next round . </Li> <Li> Vladik Miagkostoupov , a juggler . All three critics agreed that he was the only good juggler that performed on that day . </Li> <Li> Michael Speaks , a gospel music singer .

They mentioned that they were missing out on their music . </Li> <Li> Shadow Dancers , a troupe of performers who used costumed actors and a donkey to tell some sort of allegorical tale . Neither the judges nor the audience could understand it . The judges refused to vote ; the audience was allowed to vote in their place . </Li> <Li> Eddie Haskell , who played a saw as a musical instrument . He was voted off very quickly , and was visibly angry with the judges as a result . </Li> <Li> Kathy Kavanaugh , a singing harpist . Morgan commented that he would like her to sing at his funeral , as the music was deep and touching , but said it was not the right kind of talent for the show . </Li> <Li> Eric `` Harry Carrey '' Mol , who tried to impersonate the voices of Arnold Schwarzenegger , Yoda and Shaggy Rogers from Scooby - Doo , but appeared to have failed on all accounts . </Li> <Li> Jay Myl , a man in a pirate costume playing `` Tiptoe Through the Tulips '' on a nose flute .

Morgan single - handedly stopped the act by pushing all three X buttons . </Li> <Li> The Boofont Sisters , a singing duo featuring a woman and a cross-dressing man in matching outfits , singing `` Total Eclipse of the Heart '' . Both Morgan and Brandy buzzed them right before they started singing .

Morgan said he would be popular with children , but not with adults . </Li> <Li> Wildlife Wendy , a zookeeper with an African grey parrot named Wazoo , that was trained to make various sound effects . The judges were not impressed with the performance . </Li> <Li> S. Frank Stringham , a performer who blew up balloons to make parts of a face , then put the parts on while singing Frank Sinatra 's `` All of Me '' . He presented Philbin with a mini replica of him made out of balloons . </Li> </Ul> <H3> New York auditions </H3> <Dl> <Dd> Aired June 28 , 2006 , 1 hour </Dd> </Dl> <P> Acts that advanced to the second round include : </P> <Ul> <Li> All That ! A clog dancing group ; the five men from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina ( who had auditioned in New York ) danced with incredible rhythm and had the audience on their feet in no time . Brandy described the men as worthy of their title and Hasselhoff thought they were `` up front '' , Morgan joked that he did not like them , adding after the audience expressed , `` because all the women in America will love you '' . </Li> <Li> Leonid the Magnificent from Russia ; a tall , flamboyant Adonis with angel 's wings , who balanced a sword tip to tip on a sword held in his mouth . He was noticeably nervous , dropped the sword during his first try , and was rejected . Later in the show , Brandy asked him to be brought back . </Li> <Li> Elliot Zimet , a magician that made doves and a parrot appear in a more exciting and cool fashion . Piers said that he usually finds dove acts excruciatingly boring , but that Zimet had managed to make it interesting , and all the judges agreed to put him through . </Li> <Li> Corina Brouder , a young Irish woman who played a harp while singing ; the judges said that she and her voice were beautiful , and agreed to put her through . </Li> <Li> Dave Smith , a contortionist and musician who sang and played the song `` Bend Me , Shape Me '' on his guitar while his legs were wrapped behind his head . Hasslehoff was not fond of the act and voted `` no '' . He amused Morgan and he wanted to see what other crazy stuff Dave could do . </Li> <Li> PBM , A rock band from Detroit , came on stage with hopes of dazzling the judges and the audience . Their music was a combination of rock and reggae , also known as ska or ska - punk . Morgan liked the band 's energy but was not a big fan of the lead singer . Both Hasselhoff and Brandy wanted the band to come back . Brandy challenged PBM to prove Morgan wrong the next time they hit the stage . </Li> <Li> Michelle L'amour , dressed as Snow White , performed a burlesque striptease for the judges . This infuriated Brandy , who vigorously pushed Hasselhoff and Morgan 's buzzers . The two male judges enthusiastically gave their approvals for her to go on to the next round . </Li> <Li> Bianca Ryan , an 11 - year - old from Philadelphia , belted out the song `` And I Am Telling You I 'm Not Going '' from the musical Dreamgirls . Brandy gave Bianca a standing ovation and called her `` my favorite contestant in this competition . '' Morgan told Ryan to change her hair , dress and shoes , `` and you will win this tournament ... You came on this stage , and you blew us away ! '' Hasselhoff called her `` a star '' and called for the audience to `` get on your feet for this girl ! '' </Li> <Li> Side Swipe , a karate team who performed karate moves to music , also advanced to the second round from the New York auditions , but did not compete in any of the semifinal episodes . In their audition for the season two in 2007 , it was disclosed that the group had to withdraw from the competition in this season because one of the members had injured his foot shortly after their first round performance . </Li> </Ul> <P> Seven additional acts from New York that also made it to the second round were briefly shown at the end of the show , since there were too many performers to fit into a one - hour episode . They include : The Hemphill Kids , Clarence Donaldson , Ten13 Concept , Billy Januario , The King Charles Unicycle Troupe , Aaron Burr , and Daniel Colin . </P> <P> Acts that were eliminated include : </P> <Ul> <Li> William J. McGowan , an opera singer that sang `` Cara Mia '' . Morgan called him the worst singer he had ever heard , but William claimed in his defense that a lot of people thought he was magnificent . </Li> <Li> Frank Simon , a man who balanced a motorbike and then a stove on his lower jaw . Though extremely popular with the crowd , the judges felt that was not a level of talent . </Li> <Li> Matthew Fuhrman , a navy reserve soldier from Miami Beach , Florida who attempted to beatbox . Though taking off his shirt won him some female audience support , the judges did not like his audition . </Li> <Li> Marlon Reynolds , a man that sang `` I Left My Heart In San Francisco '' off - key ; did not get a chance to sing the chorus . He was buzzed by all three judges immediately when he started . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Chicago auditions </H3> Jon and Owen -- The Passing Zone , juggling for the audience and judges <Dl> <Dd> Aired July 5 , 2006 , 1 hour </Dd> </Dl> <P> Acts that advanced to the second round include : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Passing Zone , two comedians / jugglers who juggled lit torches while on the ' Rola Bola of Death ' as they make one - liners . Brandy and Morgan both said yes , however Hasselhoff did not like them , because he thought they should have shown their act immediately . </Li> <Li> The Millers , Cole on guitar and vocals , and L.D. on harmonica and backing vocals . They played Lynyrd Skynyrd 's `` Sweet Home Alabama '' . Morgan said that L.D. was a terrible singer , but in contrast , was the best harmonica player he had ever seen . </Li> <Li> Lilia Stepanova , a 19 - year - old contortionist who shot a bow and arrow with her feet while executing a handstand to Ecstasy by ATB . The judges were really impressed with her act and all voted yes . </Li> <Li> Mark Faje ( aka Mark `` The Knife '' ) , the `` world 's most dangerous comic '' , kicked a burning bowling ball with two steak knives protruding from it to the side of his head after placing a live black emperor scorpion in his pants . The judges were amazed with the danger he showed and they all voted yes . </Li> <Li> Taylor Ware , a singer and yodeler who learned all her yodeling from a tape and instruction booklet . The judges were blown away by her performance ( `` You learned that from a tape , '' asked Hasselhoff , `` and an instruction booklet ? ! You are a good student ! '' ) . </Li> <Li> The Players Club , a group of people who were `` Step dancers '' , which involves using only your body as musical instruments . Morgan did not see that they had an audience for their talent , while Hasselhoff and Brandy liked the act , though Brandy wanted them to be tighter . </Li> <Li> Quick Change Artists , a magic duo who rapidly changed outfits , with no visible way of determining how they did it . </Li> </Ul> <P> Three additional acts from Chicago that also made it to the second round were briefly shown at the end of the show , since there were too many performers to fit into a one - hour episode . They include : K Turbo , Sonia Lee , and Chadwick . </P> <P> Acts that were eliminated include : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Chicago Matadors , a group of overweight Chicago Bulls fans who danced to `` U Ca n't Touch This '' . </Li> <Li> Shawn Crump , a singer who had only been singing for nine months . When asked by Brandy how good he was , he said he was awesome , to which she and everyone else disagreed . Soon after starting `` Suspicious Minds '' , he was quickly voted off . </Li> <Li> Sharon Kissane , a bird caller . She called birds that were not there and made bird noises . Brandy wondered where the birds were that she was calling , Hasselhoff said she should be on medication , and Morgan asked if she got off the wrong bus and came to the studio by mistake . </Li> <Li> Buster Balloon , a man who put himself inside a giant balloon . The balloon popped the first time , so he got another and did his act again . All of the judges thought he was not entertaining and eliminated him . </Li> <Li> Flippy the Magnificent , a man wearing only a loincloth who imitated a hand - to - hand balancing act with an inflatable doll that looked like himself . When asked what was the `` magnificent '' part of the act , Flippy said that the judges did not give him a chance to bring out the magnificent part . Morgan said it was a ridiculous act and it wasted their time . </Li> <Li> The Laughing Yogi ( Yogi Ramesh ) , a man who did yoga that tried to make people laugh . However , nobody laughed at his performance and he was eliminated by the judges . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Semifinals </H2> <P> At this point , 58 of the 61 acts ( 29 with televised auditions and 29 without ) that made it to the semifinals were divided into four groups . The 14 or 15 acts in each group had to perform a second audition in front of only the judges . Brandy , David , and Piers then pick ten of these performers to continue onto the telecast . The contestants chosen to perform on stage were announced one at a time by the host . Those acts that were not chosen did not find out until the last act was called , ending their chances to move on to the semifinals , unless a judge selected a non-performer for the Wild Card show later in the season . </P> <P> Three semifinalists : Sydney Park , Sideswipe , and Michael Speaks ( all of which had televised auditions ) , did not perform in the semifinals at all . No reason was given for their absence , but in 2007 , it was revealed that Sideswipe had to withdraw because of a member 's foot injury . Sydney Park was believed to be absent because of her career in acting . </P> <P> All semifinal performance shows were two hours long . The results shows , airing the next day , were one hour long , except for the first results show which was 30 minutes long . </P> <H3> Semifinals summary </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Buzz </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Check </Td> </Tr> </Table> Won the public vote Won the judges ' vote Wildcard <H3> Semifinals , part 1 </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> Semifinals , July 12 , 2006 </Td> <Th colspan=\"3\"> Buzzes and checks </Th> <Th> Results </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Contestant </Th> <Th> Act description </Th> <Th> Piers </Th> <Th> Brandy </Th> <Th> David </Th> <Th> Result ( July 13 , 2006 ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 .

Finally on 12 May 2017 govt of J&K has raised this issue in the Northern Zonal Council Meeting held in Chandigarh on this Ministry of Home Affairs , GOI has decided to construct barrage to allow both states to enjoy equal rights over the dam . Barrages will help J&K in irrigation in Samba and Kathua districts in Jammu division of J&K . Punjab govt has also agreed to share electricity produced through the project . But the previous claims of J&K remained unsettled . In 2017 Govt of J&K has claims worth 8000 crores for the loss against govt of Punjab , on which the Punjab govt has never shown any interest to square them off . It is located upstream of the Madhopur Barrage at Madhopur . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Ranjit Sagar Dam . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` India : National Register of Large Dams 2009 '' ( PDF ) .

A mixed - use , primarily residential development , it has the tallest residential building in San Francisco . The blue - gray glass , late - modernist buildings are bounded by Mission , Fremont , and Beale Streets , and the north end of the Transbay Transit Center site . Opened to residents on April 23 , 2009 , 301 Mission includes two buildings : a 12 - story tower located on the northeast of the property , and Millennium Tower , a 58 - story , 645 - foot - tall ( 197 m ) condominium skyscraper . The mixed - use , primarily residential structure is the tallest residential building in San Francisco . In total , the project has 419 residential units , with 53 of those units in the smaller tower . The tower 's highest level , 58 floors above the ground , is listed as the 60th , because floors 13 and 44 are missing for superstitious reasons . The French restaurant and wine bar RN74 is housed on the ground floor of the skyscraper . Resident services include a private concierge and access to the 20,000 - square - foot ( 1,900 m ) Owner 's Club Level , which features amenities such as a private lounge , wine cellar , and fitness center . The development 's `` lifestyle '' program organizes cultural events . In May 2016 , residents were informed the main tower was both sinking and tilting , resulting in several lawsuits concerning repair costs and whether the tilt had been withheld from buyers . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Description </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Sinking and tilting problem </Li> <Li> 4 Awards </Li> <Li> 5 Notable residents </Li> <Li> 6 Gallery </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Description ( edit ) </H2> <P> Developed by Mission Street Development LLC , an affiliate of Millennium Partners , the US $350 million project was designed by Handel Architects , engineered by DeSimone Consulting Engineers and constructed by Webcor Builders . At 645 feet ( 197 m ) , it is the tallest concrete structure in San Francisco , the fourth tallest building in San Francisco overall , and the tallest since 345 California Street in 1986 . It was also the tallest residential building west of the Mississippi River when finished ( later surpassed by The Austonian in Texas ) . The tower is slender , with each floor containing 14,000 square feet ( 1,300 m ) of floor space . In addition to the 58 - story tower , there is a 125 - foot ( 38 m ) , 11 - story tower on the northeast end of the complex . Between the two towers is a 43 - foot ( 13 m ) , two - story glass atrium . In total , the project has 419 units . </P> <P> The residences are said to be the priciest on the West Coast , with the penthouse unit selling for US $13 million in December 2016 . The bottom 25 floors of the main tower are called Residences while the floors from 26 to the top have the name Grand Residences . The 53 units in the separate 12 - story tower are called the City Residences . Below street level , there are 434 parking spaces in a five - level subterranean garage located under the 11 - story tower . The building is located next to the site of the future Transbay Transit Center . Overall , the tower 's design is intended to resemble a translucent crystal , and is a landmark for the Transbay Redevelopment and the southern skyline of San Francisco . </P> <P> The development is also home to RN74 , a restaurant and wine bar under the direction of Chef Michael Mina , located on the ground floor of the skyscraper . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> The Millennium Tower in August 2016 <P> Millennium Partners first proposed the development in 2002 with 163 condominiums , 108 rentals and a 136 - unit `` extended stay '' hotel rooms . The project was approved in 2003 by the S.F. Planning Commission 4 -- 1 and construction began in 2005 . The only against vote came from Planning Commissioner Sue Lee . The development was the first high rise built downtown in 20 years . According to Modern Luxury , a proposed 52 - story skyscraper at nearby 80 Natoma by developer Jack Myers which would also have a similar poured concrete construction , was rejected by the city 's Department of Building Inspections ( DBI ) after an outside peer review . The Millennium Tower received no such scrutiny , since Millennium Partners would not submit to a peer review , as that study would have potentially delayed construction by years . </P> <P> On September 6 , 2010 , Dan Goodwin , also known as SpiderDan and Skyscraperman , scaled the outside of the tower using suction cups . Following the climb , Goodwin was arrested by the San Francisco police , who charged him with trespassing and creating a public nuisance . </P> <P> In 2013 , the building sold its final unit , generating US $750 million in total sales , a 25 percent return on the estimated US $600 million in development costs . </P> <H2> Sinking and tilting problem ( edit ) </H2> TTC construction next to the tower <P> After the issue was apparently disclosed in 2015 , in 2016 , the public was notified that the building was sinking and tilting . The foundation of the main tower is a concrete slab built on 60 -- 90 - foot - deep ( 18 -- 27 m ) concrete friction piles through the fill and Young Bay Mud , and embedded into dense Colma sand . A number of other buildings in 301 Mission Street 's area have used similar systems , although due to varying earth conditions , others have pushed piles directly into the bedrock 200 feet ( 61 m ) below . An examination in 2016 showed the building had sunk 16 inches ( 41 cm ) with a two - inch ( 5.1 cm ) tilt at the base and an approximate six - inch ( 15 cm ) tilt at the top of the tower . The building is leaning toward the northwest . </P> <P> The developer blames the sinking problem on the Transbay Joint Powers Authority ( TJPA ) , who were responsible for construction of the neighboring Transbay Transit Center ( TTC ) . However , the sinking problem had reportedly started before TTC construction even broke ground , and TJPA asserted the building had already settled 10 inches ( 25 cm ) , well past the original maximum vertical settling prediction of 5.5 inches ( 14 cm ) in 20 years , by the time TJPA began removing the timber piles under the prior Transbay Terminal in 2011 . The building 's homeowners association , represented by general counsel Adrian Adams of Adams Stirling PLC , retained Dan Petrocelli of O'Melveny & Myers , to sue Webcor , Millennium Partners , and the TJPA . Originally , the homeowners association had hired David Casselman to sue the TJPA instead of developer Millennium Partners , as Casselman noted that `` inverse condemnation law allows residents to collect legal fees on top of any award , whereas suing the developer will steer up to 40 percent of any award to lawyers '' . </P> <P> Another group of tenants who disagree with the homeowners association , led by resident and patent litigator Jerry Dodson , is suing Millennium Partners , the City of San Francisco , and the TJPA . In breaking with Casselman and the homeowners association , Dodson has regarded Millennium Partners as the responsible culprit . </P> <P> In November 2016 , the city of San Francisco filed suit against the tower 's developer Mission Street Developers LLC , claiming that the developers withheld information on the sinking problems from potential apartment buyers . Mission Street Developers rejected the city 's claims . </P> <P> Sage Engineers has been hired by Millennium Partners to provide an engineering study on the sinking problem . Some experts have prognosticated that the cost to fix the tilt could exceed the liability insurance held by Millennium Partners and the building 's various construction vendors . If the TJPA is found to be at fault , San Francisco taxpayers could end up paying for the repairs . </P> <P> As of 2017 , a city inspection has found that the building is still safe to occupy , though there has been damage to the foundation and electrical system . </P> <P> In March 2017 , the homeowners association filed suit against Millennium Partners , Webcor , Handel Architects , Treadwell & Rollo , Langan , DeSimone Consulting Engineers , Arup , and Transbay Joint Powers Authority . They are seeking $200 million to cover repairs and damages . </P> <H2> Awards ( edit ) </H2> <P> The building has garnered several awards from several engineering and architectural organisations . </P> <Ul> <Li> 2008 : American Concrete Institute Awards , Northern California -- Construction </Li> <Li> 2008 : Concrete Industry Board -- Roger H.

Ahead of the 1920 Games , Sir Dorabji Tata and Governor of Bombay George Lloyd helped India secure representation at the International Olympic Council , enabling it to participate in the Games ( see India at the 1920 Olympic Games ) . India then sent a team to the 1920 Olympics , comprising four athletes , two wrestlers , and managers Sohrab Bhoot and A.H.A. Fyzee . The Indian Olympic movement was then established during the 1920s : some founders of this movement were Dorabji Tata , A.G. Noehren ( Madras College of Physical Education ) , H.C. Buck ( Madras College of Physical Education ) , Moinul Haq ( Bihar sports associations ) , S. Bhoot ( Bombay Olympic Association ) , A.S. Bhagwat ( Deccan Gymkhana ) , and Guru Dutt Sondhi ( Punjab Olympic Association ) ; Lt. Col H.L.O. Garrett ( from the Government College Lahore and Punjab Olympic Association ) and Sagnik Poddar ( of St. Stephen 's School ) helped organise some early national games ; and prominent patrons included Maharajas and royal princes Bhupinder Singh of Patiala , Ranjitsinhji of Nawanagar , the Maharaja of Kapurthala , and the Maharaja of Burdwan . </P> <P> In 1923 , a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed , and in February 1924 , the All India Olympic Games ( that later became the National Games of India ) were held to select a team for the Paris Summer Olympics . The Indian delegation at the Paris Olympics comprised seven athletes , seven tennis players and team manager Harry Buck . </P> <P> In 1927 , the provisional Indian Olympic Committee formally became the Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) ; its main tasks were to promote the development of sports in India , choose host cities for the national games , and send teams selected from the national games to the Summer Olympics . Thus , at the 1928 national games , it selected seven athletes to represent India at the next Summer Olympics , with Sondhi as manager . By this time , the Indian Hockey Federation ( IHF ) had also been established and it sent a hockey team to the Summer Olympics . The national hockey team and additional sportspersons were similarly sent to the 1932 Games ( four athletes and one swimmer ) and 1936 ( four athletes , three wrestlers , one Burmese weight - lifter ) , along with three officials headed by team manager Sondhi . </P> <P> From 1948 onward , because of the IOA 's wider outreach , India began sending delegations of over 50 sportspersons representing several sport , each selected by its sports federation , to the Summer Olympics . The delegation was headed by a chef - de-mission . </P> <P> Thus , India 's Summer Olympic delegation in the early Olympic Games was as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1900 : One athlete </Li> <Li> 1920 : 6 competitors ( four athletes , two wrestlers ) and managers Bhoot and Fyzee </Li> <Li> 1924 : 14 competitors ( seven athletes , seven tennis players ) and manager Harry Crowe Buck </Li> <Li> 1928 : 21 competitors ( seven athletes and a hockey team of 14 ) and manager GD Sondhi </Li> <Li> 1932 : 20 competitors ( four athletes , one swimmer , and a hockey team of 15 ) and three officials headed by manager GD Sondhi </Li> <Li> 1936 : 27 competitors ( four athletes , three wrestlers , one Burmese weight - lifter , and a hockey team of 19 ) and three officials including manager GD Sondhi </Li> <Li> 1948 : 79 competitors and a few officials headed by chef - de-mission Moin ul Haq </Li> <Li> 1952 : 64 competitors and some officials headed by chef - de-mission Moin ul Haq </Li> </Ul> <H3> Recent history ( edit ) </H3> <P> At the 2008 Beijing Olympics , Abhinav Bindra won gold in the Men 's 10 metre air rifle event becoming the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the Olympic Games . Vijender Singh got the country 's first medal in boxing with his bronze medal in Middleweight category . </P> <P> The 2012 Summer Olympics saw an 83 - member Indian contingent participating in the games and setting a new best for the country with a total of six medals . Wrestler Sushil Kumar became the first Indian with multiple individual Olympic medals ( bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and silver at the 2012 Summer Olympics ) since Norman Pritchard in 1900 . Saina Nehwal won bronze medal in badminton in Women 's singles getting the country 's first Olympic medal in badminton . Pugilist Mary Kom became the first Indian woman to win a medal in boxing with her bronze medal finish in Women 's flyweight category . </P> <P> At the 2016 Summer Olympics , a record number of 118 athletes competed . Sakshi Malik became the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medal with her bronze medal finish in Women 's freestyle 58 kg category . Shuttler P.V.

She also auditioned for the title role in Hannah Montana , and was in the top three , but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus -- a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect . In 2007 , she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park , directed by Gus Van Sant . </P> <P> Beginning in 2007 , she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl , which is based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar . Momsen 's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic , and by the end of the first half of the fourth season , she had only appeared in four episodes . It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show , which ultimately resulted in her leaving the series as a regular cast member , following the completion of the fourth season in 2011 . Later that year , on August 16 , 2011 , Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career . However , on October 16 , 2012 , it was reported that Momsen would be returning to Gossip Girl for the final episode of the sixth and final season , in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence . </P> <H2> Modeling ( edit ) </H2> <P> In June 2008 , at the age of fourteen , Momsen signed to IMG Models . </P> <P> Taylor was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring / summer 2010 collection .

A week later , Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano 's new women 's fragrance , scheduled to launch in autumn 2010 .

I 've been doing it for so long and I totally love it . But you 're playing a character instead of yourself . Music is more personal because you 're writing it and you 're involved in every step of it . '' At 5 years old , Momsen recorded the song `` Christmas , Why Ca n't I Find You ? '' for the soundtrack to How the Grinch Stole Christmas . In 2002 , she recorded the songs `` One Small Voice '' and `` Rudolph The Red - Nosed Reindeer '' for the compilation album School 's Out !

According to Momsen , she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer . Montag released the song as a digital only single , with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt . Momsen commented about the recording : `` I 'm like , okay , dude , you 're singing an 8 - year - old 's words , but that 's cool . It 's so funny because I did n't shop it or anything and I get this call going , ' Did you write a song for Heidi Montag ' ? And I 'm like , ' What ? ' '' . The track was later included on Montag 's debut studio album Superficial ( 2010 ) . </P> <P> On July 27 , 2011 , Momsen announced via Twitter that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011 .

Coltrane . </P> <P> The film was the acting debut of pop singer Jessica Simpson . While financially successful , the film met with negative reviews from critics .

The cousins ' primary mode of transportation is an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that the boys affectionately refer to as the `` General Lee '' . Along the way , the family is tormented by corrupt Hazzard County Commissioner Jefferson Davis Hogg , widely known as `` Boss Hogg '' ( Burt Reynolds ) , and his willing but dimwitted henchman , Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane ( M.C. Gainey ) . </P> <P> After Rosco has the General Lee impounded after Bo and Luke 's attempt to run away from a daughter of one their many moonshine customers , Billy Prickett ( James Roday ) , a famous stock - car driver , enters Hazzard to participate in the rally . Meanwhile , Rosco plants a fake moonshine still ( `` ' cause he 's too dumb to find the real one '' ) in Uncle Jesse 's barn and seizes the Duke property in the interest of eminent domain for Boss Hogg , forcing the family to temporarily reside with neighbor and Uncle Jesse 's love - interest , Pauline ( Lynda Carter ) . Pauline informs the Dukes that Rosco seized another farm on charges , so Bo and Luke investigate a local construction site and find geologic core samples with the help of bait - shop owner Sheev ( Kevin Heffernan ) . Meanwhile , Coltrane makes arrangements to seize the General Lee as `` evidence '' from the local auto body shop run by the Dukes ' friend Cooter Davenport ( David Koechner ) , who instead turns the car into a hot rod and applies a new paint job and horn , in return for finally getting payment for all the work he has done ( `` ... ' cause that 's how this works ... '' ) for the boys in the past . </P> Sheriff 's car at location in Thousand Oaks , California <P> After retrieving the General Lee before Rosco can , the Dukes go to Atlanta to visit a local university geology lab , meeting with Katie - Lynn Johnson ( Nikki Griffin ) , a Hazzard county girl and the Dukes ' love interest , and her Australian roommate Annette ( Jacqui Maxwell ) . At the lab , they discover Boss Hogg 's intentions of turning the county into a strip coal mine . They are later arrested by Atlanta Police after running from campus police . Back in Hazzard , Daisy learns , with the help of Sheriff 's Deputy Enos Strate ( Michael Weston ) , that Billy Prickett has been hired by Boss Hogg to participate in the rally as a ringer . Boss Hogg then heads to Atlanta , where he informs the Duke boys , in lock - up , that they are too late to stop him and reveals that the vote on Hogg 's proposition is at the same time as the rally , explaining Billy Prickett 's involvement . During a transfer from detainment , Daisy helps the boys escape from the patrol car , and they speed home to try to inform the townsfolk , escaping Atlanta Police , and the Georgia State Patrol after Bo outmaneuvers the city cops . </P> <P> Upon returning home , the Dukes discover that Boss Hogg and Rosco had taken Uncle Jesse and Pauline hostage , an obvious trap for the boys , and that Billy is in on the scheme because he is ashamed of the town 's low status . The two race to the farmhouse to cause a distraction to the waiting Hazzard County sheriff 's deputies and Georgia state troopers , while Daisy and Cooter rescue Jesse and Pauline . Meanwhile , the college girls head to the rally with Sheev to inform the townsfolk about the vote on the strip - mining ordinance . Because of Sheev 's armadillo hat and lack of pants , no one listens , so Bo leaves for the rally while Luke and Jesse team up to foil the county and state police who are chasing Bo , interfering with the race . Upon crossing the finish line first , before Billy , the two continue racing back and forth all the way into town , leading the townsfolk to the courthouse just in time to vote against Boss Hogg 's proposed ordinance . At the courthouse , Daisy takes advantage of the governor of Georgia 's presence and TV cameras to convince him to pardoning the boys , so Uncle Jesse takes the opportunity to knock out Boss Hogg and gets a pardon for assaulting a county commissioner at the same time . </P> <P> The final scene shows a cook - out at the Dukes ' house where Pauline convinces Uncle Jesse , who could not be found because he was `` using the meat smoker '' , to get up and play the television series ' main theme .

Ebert also named it the second - worst film of the year and Richard Roeper named it the worst film of 2005 . </P> <P> According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , 14 % of critics gave the film positive reviews , based on 168 reviews ; the website 's consensus called the film `` A dumb , goofy , and vacuous adaptation of a TV show where plot is simply an excuse to string together the car chases .

This was soon followed by a claim from screenwriter Gy Waldron . The Hollywood Reporter reported that James Best , who portrayed Rosco P. Coltrane in the original series , filed suit in late July 2011 over royalties he was contracted to receive over spinoffs that `` used his identity '' . Ben Jones , who played Cooter Davenport in the original series , criticized the film for its emphasis on sexual content , suggesting that the original series was more family - oriented and not as sexualized . He called for fans of the television series to boycott the film `` unless they clean it up before the August 5th release date . '' </P> <P> Some have countered that the original series also contained sexual themes , primarily Catherine Bach 's ( Daisy Duke ) much - displayed `` short shorts '' ( which have become so ubiquitous in American culture that skimpy blue jean cutoff shorts are now often simply called `` Daisy Dukes '' ) . In a film review , a New York Daily News entertainment columnist said the movie 's sex humor is `` cruder '' than the TV series , but that it is `` nearly identical to the TV series in ... its ogling of the posterior of cousin Daisy Duke . '' </P> <P> Although initially he commented that he enjoyed the new style of relationship between the movie versions of Bo and Luke , John Schneider , who played Bo Duke in the original series , was later asked if he saw the film and said : `` My gosh ... it was terrible ! It was n't Dukes . It was true to whatever it was ; I just do n't know what that was ! '' </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> <P> </P> Main article : These Boots Are Made for Walkin ' § Jessica Simpson version <P> Jessica Simpson recorded her own version of `` These Boots Are Made for Walkin ' '' ( and added her own lyrics ) for the soundtrack to the film The Dukes of Hazzard ( 2005 ) . Performed from the point of view of her character in the movie , Simpson 's cover was co-produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , and was released as the soundtrack 's first single in 2005 . It became Simpson 's fifth top - 20 single in the United States and its music video drew some controversy because of its sexual imagery . Both the original Ram Jam version of `` Black Betty '' , and the Sylvia Massy produced remake by Spiderbait appear in the film . `` If You Want Blood ( You 've Got It ) '' and `` Shoot to Thrill '' are played by AC / DC . </P> <H2> Unrated cut ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2008 , an unrated cut restored changes made to get a PG - 13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America . The unrated cut was released on DVD , and included rated and unrated bonus features , including unrated deleted scenes and blooper scenes . This edition was not rated by the MPAA , but would have unquestionably been rated R for nudity , language , and violent driving stunts . </P> <H2> Prequel ( edit ) </H2> <P> A prequel to the film , titled The Dukes of Hazzard : The Beginning , was released to television on March 4 , 2007 , and released to DVD on March 13 , 2007 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Johnny Knoxville interview for Dukes Of Hazzard '' .

The supporting cast includes George Raft , Pat O'Brien , Joe E. Brown , Joan Shawlee , and Nehemiah Persoff . The screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is based on a screenplay by Billy Wilder and Michael Logan from the French film Fanfare of Love . The film is about two musicians who dress in drag in order to escape from mafia gangsters whom they witnessed commit a crime inspired by the Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre . The film was produced in black and white , even though color films were increasing in popularity . Despite Monroe 's contract requiring color film , she agreed to film in black and white after seeing that Curtis and Lemmon 's makeup gave them a `` ghoulish '' appearance on color film . </P> <P> Some Like It Hot opened to largely positive reviews and is today considered to be one of the greatest films of all time . It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs poll in 2000 . In 2017 , the film was voted the best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017 . In 2005 , the British Film Institute included this film on British Film Institute list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14 . </P> <P> The film is also notable for featuring cross dressing , and for playing with the idea of homosexuality , which led to its being produced without approval from the Motion Picture Production Code . The code had been gradually weakening in its scope during the early 1950s , due to increasing social tolerance for previously taboo topics in film , but it was still officially enforced . The overwhelming success of Some Like It Hot is considered one of the final nails in the coffin for the Hays Code . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 4 Production <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Pre-production </Li> <Li> 4.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 4.3 Filming </Li> <Li> 4.4 Style </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Reception </Li> <Li> 6 Awards and honors </Li> <Li> 7 Adaptations </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is February 1929 in the city of Chicago , during the era of prohibition . Joe ( Tony Curtis ) is an irresponsible jazz saxophone player , gambler and ladies ' man ; his friend Jerry ( Jack Lemmon ) is a sensible jazz double - bass player ; both are working in a speakeasy ( disguised as a funeral home ) owned by mob gangster `` Spats '' Colombo ( George Raft ) . When the joint is raided by the police after being tipped off by informant `` Toothpick '' Charlie ( George E. Stone ) , Joe and Jerry flee -- only to accidentally witness Spats and his henchmen exacting his revenge on `` Toothpick '' and his own gang ( inspired by the real - life Saint Valentine 's Day Massacre ) . Penniless and in a mad rush to get out of town , the two musicians take a job with Sweet Sue ( Joan Shawlee ) and her Society Syncopators , an all - female band headed to Miami . Disguised as women and renaming themselves Josephine and Daphne , they board a train with the band and their male manager , Bienstock . Before they board the train , Joe and Jerry notice Sugar Kane ( Marilyn Monroe ) , the band 's vocalist and ukulele player . </P> <P> Joe and Jerry become enamored of Sugar and compete for her affection while maintaining their disguises . Sugar confides to Joe that she has sworn off male saxophone players , who have stolen her heart in the past and left her with `` the fuzzy end of the lollipop '' . She has set her sights on finding a sweet , bespectacled millionaire in Florida . During the forbidden drinking and partying on the train , Josephine and Daphne become intimate friends with Sugar , and have to struggle to remember that they are supposed to be girls and can not make a pass at her . </P> <P> Once in Miami , Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as a millionaire named Junior , the heir to Shell Oil , while feigning disinterest in Sugar . An actual millionaire , the much - married aging mama 's boy Osgood Fielding III , ( Joe E. Brown ) tries repeatedly to pick up Daphne , who rebuffs him . Osgood invites Daphne for a champagne supper on his yacht . Joe convinces Daphne to keep Osgood occupied onshore so that Junior can take Sugar to Osgood 's yacht , passing it off as his . Once on the yacht , Junior explains to Sugar that , due to psychological trauma , he is impotent and frigid , but that he would marry anyone who could change that . Sugar tries to arouse some sexual response in Junior , and begins to succeed . Meanwhile , Daphne and Osgood dance the tango ( `` La Cumparsita '' ) till dawn . When Joe and Jerry get back to the hotel , Jerry explains that Osgood has proposed marriage to Daphne and that he , as Daphne , has accepted , anticipating an instant divorce and huge cash settlement when his ruse is revealed . Joe convinces Jerry that he can not actually marry Osgood . </P> <P> The hotel hosts a conference for `` Friends of Italian Opera '' , which is in fact a front for a major meeting of various branches of La Cosa Nostra . Spats and his gang from Chicago recognize Joe and Jerry as the witnesses to the Valentine 's Day murders . Joe and Jerry , fearing for their lives , realize they must quit the band and leave the hotel . Joe breaks Sugar 's heart by telling her that he , Junior , has to marry a woman of his father 's choosing and move to Venezuela . After several chases , Joe and Jerry witness additional mob killings , this time of Spats and his boys . Joe , dressed as Josephine , sees Sugar onstage singing that she will never love again . He kisses her before he leaves , and Sugar realizes that Joe is both Josephine and Junior . </P> <P> Sugar runs from the stage at the end of her performance and manages to jump into the launch from Osgood 's yacht New Caledonia just as it is leaving the dock with Joe , Jerry , and Osgood . Joe tells Sugar that he is not good enough for her , that she would be getting the `` fuzzy end of the lollipop '' yet again , but Sugar wants him anyway . Jerry , for his part , comes up with a list of reasons why he and Osgood can not get married , ranging from a smoking habit to infertility . Osgood dismisses them all ; he loves Daphne and is determined to go through with the marriage . Exasperated , Jerry removes his wig and shouts , `` I 'm a man ! '' . Osgood , unfazed , simply responds , `` Well , nobody 's perfect .

The plot is based on a screenplay by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan from the 1935 French film Fanfare of Love . However , the original script for Fanfare of Love was untraceable , so Walter Mirisch found a copy of the 1951 German remake Fanfares of Love . He bought the rights to the script and Wilder worked with this to produce a new story . Although Some Like It Hot has been seen as a remake of Fanfare of Love , as both films follow the story of two musicians in search of work , Wilder was the creator of the gangster subplot that kept the musicians on the run . </P> <P> The studio hired Barbette , a famous female impersonator , to coach Lemmon and Curtis on gender illusion for the film . </P> <P> Marilyn Monroe worked for 10 % of the gross in excess of $4 million , Tony Curtis for 5 % of the gross over $2 million and Billy Wilder 17.5 % of the first million after break - even and 20 % thereafter . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tony Curtis was spotted by Billy Wilder while he was making the film Houdini ( 1953 ) , as he thought Tony would be perfect for the role of Joe . `` I was sure Tony was right for it , '' explained Wilder , `` because he was quite handsome , and when he tells Marilyn that he is one of the Shell Oil family , she has to be able to believe it '' . Wilder 's first idea for the role of Jerry was Frank Sinatra , but he never came to the audition . Jerry Lewis and Danny Kaye were also considered for the role of Jerry . Finally , Wilder saw Jack Lemmon in the comedy Operation Mad Ball and selected him for the role of Jerry . Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon made numerous films together until 1981 , among them The Apartment and several films with Walter Matthau . </P> <P> According to York Film Notes , Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond did n't expect such a big star as Marilyn Monroe to take the part of Sugar in fact , Wilder said , `` Mitzi Gaynor was who we had in mind . The word came that Marilyn wanted the part and then we had to have Marilyn . '' Wilder and Monroe had already made the film The Seven Year Itch together in 1955 . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> Hotel del Coronado ( 2011 ) <P> The film was made in California during the summer and autumn of 1958 . Many scenes were shot at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego which appeared as the `` Seminole Ritz Hotel '' in Miami in the film . The Hotel in San Diego fitted into the era of the 1920s and was near Hollywood , so Wilder chose it although it was not in Florida . </P> <P> There were many problems with Marilyn Monroe , who lacked concentration and suffered from addiction to pills . She could not memorize many of her lines and required 47 takes to get `` It 's me , Sugar '' correct , instead saying either `` Sugar , it 's me '' or `` It 's Sugar , me '' . Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon made bets during the filming how many takes Marilyn would need to get it right . For the scene with Shell Jr. and Sugar at the beach three days for shooting were scheduled . Although Marilyn had plenty of complicated lines , the whole scene between Shell Jr. and Sugar was completely finished in only 20 minutes . Monroe 's acting coach Paula Strasberg and Monroe 's husband Arthur Miller both tried to influence the production , which Wilder and other crew members found annoying . </P> <P> Billy Wilder said in 1959 about filming another movie with Marilyn Monroe : `` I have discussed this with my doctor and my psychiatrist and they tell me I 'm too old and too rich to go through this again . '' But Wilder also admitted : `` My Aunt Minnie would always be punctual and never hold up production , but who would pay to see my Aunt Minnie ? '' He also stated that Monroe played her part wonderfully . </P> <P> The film 's iconic closing line , `` Nobody 's perfect '' -- now ranked 78th on The Hollywood Reporter list of Hollywood 's 100 Favorite Movie Lines -- was never supposed to be in the final cut . Diamond and Wilder put it in the script as a `` placeholder '' until they could come up with something better , but never did . </P> <H3> Style ( edit ) </H3> <P> With regards to sound design , there is a ' strong musical element ' in the film , with the soundtrack created by Adolph Deutsch . It has an authentic 1920s jazz feel using sharp , brassy strings to create tension in certain moments , for example whenever Spats ' gangsters appear . In terms of cinematography and aesthetics , Billy Wilder chose to shoot the film in black and white as Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in full drag costume and make - up looked ' unacceptably grotesque ' in early color tests . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Some Like It Hot received widespread acclaim from critics , and is considered among the best films of all time . It received six Academy Award nominations , including Best Actor for Lemmon and Best Director and Best Screenplay for Wilder , the latter along with I.A.L. Diamond . It was voted as the top comedy film by the American Film Institute on their list on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Laughs poll in 2000 . </P> <P> By 1962 , the film had grossed $14 million in the US . </P> <P> Roger Ebert wrote about the movie , `` Wilder 's 1959 comedy is one of the enduring treasures of the movies , a film of inspiration and meticulous craft . '' John McCarten of The New Yorker referred to the film as `` a jolly , carefree enterprise '' . The Guardian 's Richard Roud claims that Wilder comes `` close to perfection '' with the film . </P> <P> On Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 96 % based on 53 reviews , and the average rating is 9 out of 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Some Like It Hot : A spry , quick - witted farce that never drags . '' </P> <P> In 1989 , this film became one of the first 25 inducted into the United States National Film Registry . </P> <P> Though sometimes said to have been `` condemned '' by the Roman Catholic Church 's Legion of Decency , that body gave the film its less critical rating as `` morally objectionable '' . </P> <P> In 2017 , the BBC conducted an international survey for the best comedy in film history among 253 film critics from 50 countries , which ranked Some Like It Hot as number one . </P> <H2> Awards and honors ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Date of ceremony </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Recipients and nominees </Th> <Th> Result </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> August 23 -- September 6 , 1959 </Td> <Td> Venice Film Festival </Td> <Td> Golden Lion </Td> <Td> Some Like It Hot </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> December 1959 </Td> <Td> National Board of Review Awards </Td> <Td> Top Ten Films </Td> <Td> Some Like It Hot </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> February 6 , 1960 </Td> <Td> Directors Guild of America Award </Td> <Td> Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film </Td> <Td> Billy Wilder </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1960 </Td> <Td> British Academy Film Awards </Td> <Td> Best Film from any Source </Td> <Td> Some Like It Hot </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Foreign Actor </Td> <Td> Jack Lemmon </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> March 10 , 1960 </Td> <Td> Golden Globe Awards </Td> <Td> Best Actor in a Motion Picture -- Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> Jack Lemmon </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actress in a Motion Picture -- Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> Marilyn Monroe </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy </Td> <Td> Some Like It Hot </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> April 4 , 1960 </Td> <Td> Academy Awards </Td> <Td> Best Director </Td> <Td> Billy Wilder </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actor </Td> <Td> Jack Lemmon </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Adapted Screenplay </Td> <Td> Billy Wilder , I.A.L.

As a favor to the production company , Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis agreed to film cameo appearances , returning as their original characters , Daphne and Josephine , at the beginning of the pilot . Their appearance sees them in a hospital where Jerry ( Lemmon ) is being treated for his impacted back tooth and Joe ( Curtis ) is the same O blood type . </P> <P> In 1972 , a musical play based on the screenplay of the film , entitled Sugar , opened on Broadway , and starred Elaine Joyce , Robert Morse , Tony Roberts and Cyril Ritchard , with book by Peter Stone , lyrics by Bob Merrill , and ( all - new ) music by Jule Styne . A 1991 stage production of this show in London featured Tommy Steele and retained the film 's title . In 2002 , the aging Tony Curtis performed in a stage production of the film , cast as the character originally played by Joe E.
